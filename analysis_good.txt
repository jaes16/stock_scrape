People seem to think because we had 2 big crash close together in 2000 and 2008, we are bound to have one soon.I want to remind people before the year 2000, we had a 20 years bullish run. Its totally not impossible we get to 2030 with no crash, especially now that the feds baby sit the market.Secondly, we have extremely nice upcoming market conditions. Stimulus checks will either get people to spend money to stimulate the economy, or get them to invest, both will help the stock market. The media is somehow trying to make us believe this is bad, but i think its just bullshit. Inflation has been ultra low for way too long, and feds actually want it to increase. They said many times they won't increase rates before 2023.Thirdly, i also think we have more upcomming money sources coming into the market than ever. People from other countries invest in US stock market. With all the GME hype, more people than ever are joining in. Again media trying to twist this to say its "bad", but obviously it isn't bad.Another point is, crashes usually happen for a reason, its not random. You can google any of past market crash and find the exact reason it happened. None of these factors are happening right now.Another point is, there is a key difference between today and 2000. In 2000, the overvalued .com companies which had PE ratios of 200.... were literally worth nothing! These companies had never made a single profit! Once people realized they invested massively in a .com web site worth jackshit... they sold it obviously. They had no reason to hold their shares.Now check this image about Nasdaq's PE Ratios: https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150305131443-nasdaq-pe-780x439.jpgObviously, you can see the 2000's pe ratios were stupid. This graph is from 2015 when it was at 31.7. What is it today? Nasdaq PE ratio as of February 25, 2021 is 38.5!!!!  5x lower than the 2000s. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NDAQ/nasdaq/pe-ratioIts irrelevant if the big hedge funds remove their money from apple and want to scare you into selling your shares. Apple is a massive amazing company that is really worth a lot, and they do make tons of profits. Its not comparable in any ways to the dot com bubble. If other people are stupid and sell their shares, SO WHAT? You will just be able to buy into this amazing company for cheaper.So hold your shares and stop worrying about a 2000 level crash, its not happening.A correction? Maybe. But who cares, this just slows us down a little. Corrections are healthy and help us avoid a real crash.EDIT: Thank you for the award! :DEDIT2: Corrected the PE ratio for nasdaq
What are three growth stocks that you're very confident will grow substantially by 2030?I think if we look back in 2010, some companies that would be pretty easy choices would include Google, Microsoft, and Apple. I don't think anyone believed they would fail by 2020. And they've provided average annual returns of around 20, 22, and 26% since then.
I want to invest long term, and if I'm gonna do that, I don't see any reason not to invest in the S&amp;P 500. But obviously, millions of peoples still choose to invest in apple, disney, coke, etc. So what am I missing here? Is the "most traders won't beat the market" an exaggeration? I would appreciate some insight.
We could see a trillion in the coming months.

What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.**How can I use this list?**The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.&amp;#x200B;|Title|Tickers|Avg Hype %||:-|:-|:-||[AMERICANS CAN'T BUY GME, BB?!?! HELP IS ON THE WAY!! CANADIANS!! WE HAVE NO SUCH RESTRICTIONS!!

The portfolio will be equally balanced, at least across these 3 tickers.Is this a completely terrible idea, or do-able? I picked these 3 companies since I strongly believe in the value they create, and I am certain they will continue to create value for years.
I‘m an absolute beginner, so maybe there‘s a simple answer to that.I‘m talking Apple, Nike, Google, Microsoft, Gazprom, Walmart, Google, Adidas, Tesco, McDonalds etc.Those are just big names I googled and almost all of them had grown immensely over the past 2 years, some of them solid 50%+Am I being too selective? I feel like investing in the 5 most common street brands 5 years ago would‘ve made you a fortune by now

I would go with Disney, Hasbro, Apple, Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway- Disney is in a unique position on content. They got everything from Hulu,Pixar, Star Wars to excellent intellectual property and thousands of stories to be told.- Hasbro also is in a unique Position, as they profit from the global wealth creation, as more parents are able to spent more money for their kids. And as I believe classic games like Monopoly or Dungeons and Dragons are timeless and will be played in the future, wether it is digital or not. I also believe they will successfully make the step into the movie industry, since they got enough ip to successfully merchandise.- Apple has a huge moat. Once you use their systems, you stay with them.- Amazon makes the most out of online retail, which shouldn’t be stopped anytime soon.- What else is a better investment than giving your money to the best investor of all time ?

Just sold my shares of CCL, PENN, and DKNG. More then doubled my money on all of them.My only position left is MGM.I know very little about the stock market I got into it 2 months ago bc a friend said I could make money since most stocks crashed. Now I have no idea where to go from here as my initial strategy was to profit off of stocks wrecked by corona virus. I feel like I know nothing about what to invest in now or what is a good value as the market seems to be back to normal.It seems as if I should dump all the money into MIcrosoft, Apple, etc. any advice is appreciated
3rd QTR earnings results: iPhone is less then 50% of Apple's revenue.Services is about 20% of revenue and growing fast. Wearables is 10% of revenue and growing even faster. iPad and Mac are also growing.Amazing job by Tim Cook. Apple is no longer a 1 trick Pony and ready to continue to grow for many years.Because of this AAPL's multiple must go up. When revenue was 70% iPhone the risk of concentrated revenue streams was high. Thus Apple got docked for that. Not anymore. AAPL is a diversified company and deserves a higher PE.New 12-month target price: $275

Hi guys. So as a relatively new investor, I got in at Apple at 215, Disney at 95 and also did an etf at 240. We're going to be seeing big gains tomorrow so overall I'm going to be up about  ~20%.Chances are, the stocks will probably go up a bit more in the next few weeks and I may be prematurely selling. But I'm going to be laid off in the future and I also think that in the future, the market will drop. A 20% gain since 3 weeks ago seems solid in this uncertain market.So I'm likely going to take the gains now and ill test the market again when that time comes.

I've been following the company closely the last 6 years.Bought my first AAPL shares in late 2012 for about $80.  Bought more as Wall Street continued to bash the stock in 2013. Pick up shares at $65.And one constant I've seen:  Wall Street is constantly wrong about AAPL.  No matter how well the do. No matter how many iPhones they sell. No matter how massive the services business is and how fast its growing.No matter what Wall Street is always doubting AAPL. Always saying they are a bad quarter away from being doomed. Its really silly.But I do thank Wall Street for being wrong so much.  It allowed me to buy AAPL at ridiculously cheap prices.
#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday-*****# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-4-2021.html)*****&gt; # 1. Dow, S&amp;P 500 look to extend their rallies to four straight days&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 looked to add to their three-session winning streaks. The Nasdaq on Wednesday dipped after two straight days of strong advances. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 eked gains Wednesday following rallies Monday and Tuesday as the Reddit-fueled retail trading frenzy dissipated.&gt; * GameStop was once again volatile, finishing up nearly 2.7% at $92.41 per share Wednesday but still down 71% from Friday’s close of $325. In last week’s 400% surge, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $483 each. GameStop rose modestly in Thursday’s premarket.&gt; * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 830,000 filings for initial unemployment benefits for the week ending Jan. 30. That would be down from the prior week’s 847,000. The government reports its January employment report Friday. ADP said Wednesday 174,000 jobs were added last month at U.S. companies, more than triple expectations.*****&gt; # 2. Ken Frazier to retire as Merck CEO at end of June&gt; * Merck Chairman and CEO Ken Frazier will retire effective June 30. He’ll be replaced as CEO by company CFO Robert Davis. Frazier, 66, will become executive chairman for what the drugmaker described as a “transition period to be determined by the board.” Frazier, one of the few Black corporate leaders in the United States, has served as Merck’s chief executive since January 2011.&gt; * Frazier’s retirement was announced Thursday morning shortly before Merck reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of estimates. Per-share profit was $1.32 on $12.5 billion in revenue. Merck forecast full-year 2021 earnings between $6.48 to $6.68 per share, which were higher than analyst expectations. Dow stock Merck was little changed in the premarket.*****&gt; # 3. Apple and Hyundai-Kia pushing toward deal on Apple Car&gt; * Apple shares rose nearly 2% in Thursday’s premarket, the morning after CNBC reported, according to multiple sources, the tech giant is close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to manufacture an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia. The so-called “Apple Car,” which is being developed by a team at Apple, is tentatively scheduled to go into production in 2024, though people familiar with the talks said the eventual rollout could be pushed back.*****&gt; # 4. Klobuchar unveils antitrust reform that would impact Big Tech&gt; * Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill Thursday, setting a tough tone in her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. If enacted, it would bring significantly more risk to companies like Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google, which are already facing federal lawsuits, and to any dominant firm seeking to acquire another company. House antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., has similarly called for extensive reforms that would impact Big Tech.*****&gt; # 5. Biden signals flexibility on Covid stimulus&gt; * President Joe Biden encouraged Democratic lawmakers to “act fast” on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan but also signaled flexibility. Changes he indicated he would consider include limiting proposed $1,400 direct payments to Americans with lower income levels, which directionally could draw support from Republicans who want a much smaller package. Biden told lawmakers in private comments Wednesday he’s “not married” to an absolute number for the overall bill but wants them to “go big” on pandemic relief and “restore the soul of the country.”*****#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)*****#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/7HyJrkD.png)**)*****#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)*****#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4D1ZzFL.png)**)*****#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)*****#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/xv1RdWa.png)**)*****#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/I3EtDfQ.png)**)*****#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/oDg1a06.png)**)*****#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kyPHRhw.png)**)*****#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mrLePbl.jpg)**)*****#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qHQpeLy.png)**)######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XvyTr2i.png)**)*****#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7qIfxls.png)**)######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2Ygir5N.png)**)*****#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jOyOkJG.png)**)######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WnzRtqa.png)**)######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ouXy3Xv.png)**)*****#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/gBzCmaO.png)**)*****#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/f8ItHFz.png)**)######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/SS9oUVD.png)**)*****#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:######(**source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-canada-goose-ebay-paypal-qualcomm-more.html)**)*****&gt; **Canada Goose (GOOS)** – Canada Goose shares surged more than 15% in the premarket after the outerwear maker beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
