Realistic Contenders:-Apple Inc.-Alphabet Inc.-Microsoft-Amazon-Facebook-Alibaba-TencentOut of these I think Alibaba has the best chance of getting there. The chinese middle class is stil growing like crazy and I don't see why this stock will halt anytime soon. I think Apple has peaked as a company and it's downhill from here on out. They are not innovative anymore like rivaling companies and its losing marketshare each quarter world wide in the past year. I feel amazon is at a good place however it will not increase rapidly like it did in the past year in the near future. Microsoft will grow forever and probably the safer stock to invest in but it's a slow grower. I feel facebook has already capped out on how big it can get in its current sector. So unless they keep branching out to other areas I don't think this stock growing rapidly in the near future. Don't know much about tencent tbh. But it's growing massively.So I think Alibaba will reach the $1 trillion evaluation first with its only real challengers being alphabet and tencent.
