i've been following the company closely the last 6 years.bought my first aapl shares in late 2012 for about $80.  bought more as wall street continued to bash the stock in 2013. pick up shares at $65.and one constant i've seen:  wall street is constantly wrong about aapl.  no matter how well the do. no matter how many iphones they sell. no matter how massive the services business is and how fast its growing.no matter what wall street is always doubting aapl. always saying they are a bad quarter away from being doomed. its really silly.but i do thank wall street for being wrong so much.  it allowed me to buy aapl at ridiculously cheap prices.
