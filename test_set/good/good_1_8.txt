apple, nike, google, microsoft, gazprom, walmart, google, adidas, tesco, mcdonalds etc.those are just big names i googled and almost all of them had grown immensely over the past 2 years, some of them solid 50%+am i being too selective? i feel like investing in the 5 most common street brands 5 years ago wouldâ€˜ve made you a fortune by now
