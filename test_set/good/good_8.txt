I‘m an absolute beginner, so maybe there‘s a simple answer to that.I‘m talking Apple, Nike, Google, Microsoft, Gazprom, Walmart, Google, Adidas, Tesco, McDonalds etc.Those are just big names I googled and almost all of them had grown immensely over the past 2 years, some of them solid 50%+Am I being too selective? I feel like investing in the 5 most common street brands 5 years ago would‘ve made you a fortune by now
