**Value Stocks**The Stars Group (TSG) is up 33% this week after announcing a planned combination with Flutter Entertainment PLC, the owner of Paddy Power in the UK and Ireland. Flutter is getting a good deal, evidenced by a 6.6% jump in its own stock price, it is buying flutter for about 7x adjusted EBITDA before synergies.But TSG share holders also look set to benefit from this deal as;* TSG’s stock price has languished since it over paid for Sky Betting and took on too much debt. Flutter has much more reasonable debt levels and will be able to share the burden.* TSG’s shareholders will benefit (along with Flutter stock holders) from a rise in Flutter since they are to receive 0.2253 shares in this all stock deal.* Both entities will benefit from cost savings and the potential opportunity to dominate online betting in both Europe and the US.That market in the US alone has been estimated at between $7 billion to $9 billion. Competition will be fierce but the opportunity should allow strong double digit growth for years to come and make the current valuation (even after this weeks rise) of just 9.2x current year estimates look far too cheap.**Insider Buying**On Monday, Barron’s reported that four directors (later joined by a fifth) purchased stock in GameStop Corp in the first open-market purchases by insiders since September of 2016.The purchases were mostly above $5.00 and, even though the stock has since risen to $5.55, investors may still be interested as the stock has fallen around 66% this year. The company has been hit by an unrelenting slump in sales as customers switch to buying games online. However the outlook has some rays of light as the company should receive a boost by the launch of new consoles planned for next year.**Acquisition**Cedar Fair fell on Friday after the theme park operator turned down a $4 billion offer from Six Flags Entertainment, claiming it was inadequate. The stock closed on Friday with a market cap of $3.23 billion and there was no indication of a raised offer being forthcoming. However with synergies driving the deal, and with SG&amp;A expenses of around 15% revenues (and 120% net income), a compromise might yet be reached.**Large Caps**HP Inc dropped almost 10% on Friday (to $16.64) after the company announced a bold new strategy to reduce its workforce by 16% as part of a broad restructuring meant to cut costs and boost sales growth. HP announced that it expects profit, excluding restructuring costs and other items, to be $2.22 to $2.32 a share in fiscal 2020 (slightly above consensus $2.24). HP’s board also boosted the company’s share repurchasing plan by $5 billion on top of the $1.7 billion remaining on its existing plan. That looks significant compared to its current market cap of just under $25 billion.The market was not impressed by the announcement but, if management are successful, the stock looks cheap at less than 7.5x forward earnings. Incoming CEO Enrique Lores (who is a long standing company man with about 30 years at the firm) said “We are really confident about the future of the company.”**Speculative Opportunity**Meet Group stock price jumped almost 25% on Thursday after the company raised Q3 guidance with CEO of Meet Group, Geoff Cook saying that "New features including streamer levels, VIP badges, first time buyer bonuses and one-on-one video chat are contributing to meaningful business results. Further, we believe that the moderation-related headwinds related to our recent safety enhancements are largely behind us.”Putting the moderation-related headwinds behind them is key as the stock price dropped a few months ago due to concerns that its app was too racy for Apple and Google and might even be banned. The firm has taken steps to address those concerns and now has industry-leading safety practices including a prominent alert button for abuse reporting which sends a screenshot to Meet’s 200 moderation employees for immediate review.While Q2 results were reasonable, the updated Q3 guidance reassures investors that management’s eye is back on the ball trying to grow profits. Especially since Mr Cook also said he expected a strong Q4 "Given the ongoing stabilization in our advertising business, we anticipate a seasonally strong fourth quarter in advertising,"**Growth Stocks/High risk and speculative**On Wednesday Zynex Inc, the non-invasive medical device company for pain management, announced 95% year over year order growth for the third quarter. CEO Thomas Sandgaard attributed the rise to the company's expansion of its sales force which has doubled over the past couple of years.That’s key because the company has reported its goal to grow to 400 sales employees over the next few years and expects each to generate $1 million of sales. Margins in this business are healthy and should improve as the business grows. Gross margins were 80% at the last quarter and net margins 28%. Hitting the $400 million revenue target should generate net income well in excess of $100 million. In comparison, the stocks valuation at Friday’s close was just 3.65x that figure at $365 million.Please feel free to “FOLLOW” me if you would like to see my regular updates during the week.This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.
