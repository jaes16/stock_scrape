apple. in my opinion, all this is doing in the long-run is that you are buying tried-and-true blue chips at a discount.kohl's is not going to be larger in 10 years than it is now, and its price now does not make it a good buy.  conversely, just because tesla will be huge in the future does not mean that buying it at a pe of 1000+ is a wise investment. re-opening plays are just market chatter. crui
