Now these are just 10 that I think will be pretty big. There are going to be others that will go public in 2018 (I saw that Aston Martin is planning to go public soon at a similar valuation to Ferrari - Ticket $RACE) and some may not go public this year, but may get delayed to 2019, or 2020... or may never go public. Please add any companies you are watching to go public in 2018 in the comments so we can look into them as well. If you want to watch the video where I go more in depth on each pick, here it is: https://youtu.be/zJQagRBjDCk* 1: Spotify - Spotify is a company that has a dominance in the music streaming space, and competes with companies like Pandora, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Google Music, but has still managed to be the #1 choice for consumers. in 2018, we will most likely see this company go public. I can see them being the Netflix of music - and eventually become their own label (like original content)* 2: Uber - Popular ride sharing app that is used around the world and most people know about the company and use it regularly as well. Strong rumours that this will indeed go public in 2018, but this was also rumoured in 2017. They are valued at somewhere between 60-70B.* 3: Lyft - Competitor to Uber and also a ridesharing app. Not as big as uber around the world however the most enticing part of this company is that they have Alphabet is an investor (I believe a 1B investment from Alphabet). They are valued at somewhere between 10-15B.* 4: Avaya - Hardware company, transforming to a software and services company. They are big in the UC space, and Contact Center space as well. Main competitors are Cisco and Mitel in the same space. Recently came out of Chapter 11, and not quite sure on their valuation when they will go public.* 5: Xiaomi - This is a chinese company who primarily makes smartphones and related electronics (power banks, accessories, etc.). They are making waves in China and is a good competitor to Huawei in China. If they go public in 2018, they will come in at around a 50B valuation.* 6: Airbnb - This is a popular app for travelers. It allows you to rent out your house or room to earn a bit more income whenever you are on vacation, or if you have extra space in your house being unused. The prices are typically cheaper than hotels and I personally used it, for example for cottage rentals with friends, or when we traveled to Japan. Airbnb is great when you can't find a Hotel in a rural area, or if you want to stay in the heart of the city for cheaper than a hotel (typically). They are currently valued at 30-40B.* 7: Dropbox - They allow you to upload and share files with others online. They are essentially cloud storage, and was one of the first ones to do this before others got in the game (Apple, Google, etc.). Think of it as a hard drive that is hosted by Dropbox, and you can upload and download files from there at any time, share the files with friends, etc. Dropbox is currently valued at 10B in 2014, not sure where it's at now, but if I had to guess, I'd say 15-20B.* 8: Ancestry.com - Allows you to see your family tree. I've never used it personally, but they claim to have over 7B records from US, Canada, Europe. They offer a free trial if you're curious about family roots, so could check it out and see if you want to subscribe to their service (I personally would never...). Currently valued at around 3B.* 9: Zscaler - Cloud and security company that provides firewalls, antivirus, SSL, and anything required in keeping a secure connection. They are big in the enterprise space and have a good presence in the industry for security. Currently only valued at 1B which may be a pretty good deal for a company that provides good value.* 10: Pinterest - They are essentially a Social network. It's idea is for images and to save images to view later. For example, my wife used it before the wedding and would add different hairstyle ideas in there. She could go on google images and when she sees one she likes, there's a button to add to Pinterest. Then you have all of these pictures in 1 spot later to compare and view. The company is currently valued at around 12-13B.Share what companies you are watching to go public in 2018, and let us know if you plan to invest in any of these 10 if they do go public this year.
