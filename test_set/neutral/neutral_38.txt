What are your thoughts on Apples price movements? The stock is down over 15% from its ATH, after reporting a monster quarter. Are they still overvalued? Or is now the time to “buy the dip”?Of course we know nothing - but I am curious to hear sentiment on this stock. CNBC constantly name drops Apple to guests and guests always skip Apple and speak on Alphabet, Fb, or Microsoft.Are you waiting to purchase?
