apple or disney for below $100?** that might not happen for a long time. yeah if they buy tomorrow, the market could drop for the rest of the week, disney could fall down into the high 80s and they might have a small loss for a bit. but it will eventually fucking climb back up. it's fucking disney. not some penny stock. thinking long term, this is a good time to buy. stocks like disney will climb.
