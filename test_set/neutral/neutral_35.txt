Please check my math because the number I computed is different than the numbers a \[couple\]([https://www.thestreet.com/story/14397651/1/apple-needs-to-reach-this-share-price-to-be-worth-1-trillion.html](https://www.thestreet.com/story/14397651/1/apple-needs-to-reach-this-share-price-to-be-worth-1-trillion.html)) of other \[sites\]([https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-1-trillion-market-cap/](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-1-trillion-market-cap/)) that seem to be \[confused\]([https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/05/investing/apple-trillion-dollar-market-value-amazon/index.html](https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/05/investing/apple-trillion-dollar-market-value-amazon/index.html))(Seriously how is it someone's job to write articles like the above, and yet they can't divide 1 trillion by the number of \[shares outstanding\]([https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aapl/stock-report](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aapl/stock-report)).)Anyway, I'd stay aware of that number over the next few weeks. People tend to get into a craze whenever a price/valuation approaches a nice round number.
