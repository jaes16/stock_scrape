Hey what's up r/stocks! Good morning and happy Sunday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead this week.Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 29th, 2019.# **Investors brace for a roller-coaster week ahead with Fed decision and Apple, Alphabet earnings - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/investors-brace-for-a-roller-coaster-week-ahead-with-fed-decision-and-apple-alphabet-earnings.html)*******&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize the Fed will continue to be patient and hold back from raising interest rates, but there is a risk the Fed could inject some volatility into markets in the week ahead.*****&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, in a week heavy with earnings news and some key economic reports. Friday’s employment report tops the list of data releases, but there is also PCE inflation Monday and monthly vehicle sales Wednesday. There are more than 150 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, including Apple, Alphabet and drug majors Merck and Pfizer.*****&gt; “I don’t think the Fed is going to signal any big change in its policy stance next week. If anything, they will talk about how the economy is showing signs of improvement and therefore, it is appropriate to remain patient and see how things evolve,” said Mark Cabana, head of short U.S. rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.*****&gt; Fed officials are sure to discuss Friday’s surprisingly strong report of 3.2% economic growth in the first quarter, much better than the 2.5% pace expected by economists. It is also far better than the flattish growth forecasts and recession fears that cropped up during the first quarter when data looked spotty and the government was closed for five weeks.*****&gt; “I’m sure it’s going to heat up the internal debate on what the direction of policy should be,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. Economists expect the Fed to retain its dovish tone even with the better U.S. data because uncertainty remains about global growth, particularly from Europe.*****&gt; But some stock traders have been concerned with stocks near record highs, that the Fed may not want to sound quite as dovish, as it did after its January and March meetings when it ‘pivoted’ its policy to remove rate hikes from the forecast this year.*****&gt; “There’s some scope for disappointment there,” said Cabana.*****&gt; But then the Fed, and markets, have focused on the lack of inflation and the fact that will keep the Fed in an easier policy stance. Some market pros are counting on interest rate cuts, before the Fed ever hikes rates again.*****&gt; The Fed has targeted a 2% inflation rate. Core PCE inflation for the first quarter fell to a 1.7% pace, year over year, from 1.9% in the fourth quarter. March inflation data is released on Monday.*****&gt; “Our view has been and continues to be that the constant undershooting of core PCE that was again confirmed today is something that has the Fed perplexed, which is central to our theses that the Fed is going to cut rates later this year,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG. He expects the Fed to cut interest rates in both September and December.*****&gt; Emanuel also pointed out that first quarter GDP contained some transitory factors like a positive impact from trade and inventories that are not recurring, and inventories could even detract from second quarter growth. But some economists expect consumers to become a stronger force in the second quarter and make up for some of that.*****&gt; Emanuel said he expects the S&amp;P 500, which surpassed its previous closing high of 2,930, in the past week, to reach a high of 3,000 this year. The S&amp;P is up more than 3% in April so far, and earnings season has been mostly positive for stocks.*****&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.2% in the past week, closing Friday at 2,939, just under its all-time intra-day high of 2,940, from Sept. 21. The Nasdaq was up 1.9% for the week at a new closing high of 8,146. But the Dow was down 0.1% for the week, ending at 26,543, still 1.5% below its intra-day high.*****&gt; Big earnings week&gt; The first quarter earnings season was expected to be the first negative quarter for profit growth in three years, but as of Friday, earnings growth looks to be flattish, based on actual numbers for companies that have already reported and estimates for others, according to Refinitiv.*****&gt; According to Emanuel, the coming week’s earnings will be important, and now there are reports from big pharma. He said health care has become more attractive to him as it has come under pressure this year.*****&gt; “If you look at the rebound, that is only four months old, the easy money has been made and the easy money has been made in technology,” he said. “From our point of view, we like the places investors have had a more difficult time.” He said two of those sectors are health care and financials.*****&gt; “With regard to technology there has been an element of performance chase that has crept into the market,” he said.*****&gt; Technology, since the start of the year, has been the best performing of the major S&amp;P sectors, with a gain of 26%. Financials are up 18.4%, and health care is the worst performing sector, up just 2.5%*****&gt; “If you think about part of the reason the health care sector has been under such intense pressure recently, it is the expectation that legislatively, not only are prices rising less, but you could also have an element of deflation in that sector. Our view point is that is not likely to materialize,” Emanuel said. “We see the weakness in healthcare as much more a function of the majority of the universe is frightened by Medicare for all, and those that aren’t are frightened by the prospect of the Affordable Care Act being repealed. We don’t see either of those happening.”*****&gt; Emanuel said he’s currently being selective in buying stocks, especially given risks to the market like unresolved trade talks between the U.S. and China; the slowdown in Chinese stimulus and weaker growth, particularly in Europe.*****# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://finviz.com/publish/042619/sec_all_w1_173277427.png))**# **Major Indices for this past week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/j5dKhpy.png))**# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/kpzJXo4.png))**# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M4U0TnP.png))**# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6Bzj4Ot.png))**# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oFQ2z44.png))**# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nKZUpu2.png))**# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/geMAbkt.png))**# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KXEgJy4.png))**# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0ahuAUT.png))**# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EMNd0Tg.png))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rw9AlkZ.png))*******# Typical May Trading: Just a Couple of Positive Areas&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear “Sell in May.” But when exactly in May is the “best” time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May’s eighteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40af3b2f1d51b103a95449afb064de43/tumblr_inline_pqkyisFWm11spdppr_500.jpg))*******# Its Official – Happy 10th Birthday Bull Market&gt; Yesterday’s new all-time closing high by S&amp;P 500 finally made it official. The current bull market is now in its eleventh year and is the second longest since 1949 and second best by performance with a 333.6% gain from its March 9, 2009 low through its closing high. Since 1949, the longest bull market lived over twelves years from December 1987 to March 2000 and gained 582.1%. Thus far the current bull has endured five corrections ranging from 10.2% to 19.8%. Tame inflation, a dovish Fed and the prospects for continued earnings growth suggest this bull is likely to continue.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e3dc0a0ebbdbfa17233cc896b723138/tumblr_inline_pqhfsax1Mt1spdppr_540.jpg))*******# End of the Best Six Months. Should You Sell in May?&gt; It’s hard for us not to be associated with “Sell in May” and we welcome the opportunity it provides to discuss seasonality and share our analysis and our evidence-based, time-tested and historically-proven “Best Six Months Switching Strategy.” First of all we do not simply Sell in May and go away. And we don’t sell anything until we get a technical confirmation from our MACD Seasonal Sell Signal. When we do get that MACD Sell Signal we will sell some positions in our Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy Portfolio and pick up some bond positions as well as other portfolio maneuvers.&gt; Because of the elevated level of risk that has been historically observed during the “Worst Six Months” of the year and its historically tepid returns, reducing long exposure and developing a defensive strategy is the approach we take in the Almanac InvestorStock and ETF Portfolios. We do not merely “sell in May and go away.” Instead we take some profits, trim or outright sell underperforming stock and ETF positions, tighten stop losses and limit adding new long exposure to positions from sectors that have a demonstrated record of outperforming during the period.&gt; For those with a lower risk tolerance or a desire to take a break from trading, the “Worst Months” are a great opportunity to unwind longs and move into the relative safety of cash, Treasury bonds, gold and/or some combination of. Preservation of capital may be more important than growth and with historical averages and frequency of gains reduced; the “Worst Six Months” are a good time to simply step aside if you prefer. August, September and/or October have provided some excellent buying opportunities in recent years and could do the same again this year.&gt; Sure the market got slammed in the first two months (November-December) of the Best Six Months in 2018, nothing’s perfect. It happens. We stuck it out, did not panic at the December 24 low and road the recovery rally. The history of the Best Six/Worst Six Months is undeniable and it still works. There have been off periods throughout its history. The full history is on our website and in the Almanac. But here are a couple of graphs to illustrate.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/04e0f9f1866a883f9ba6e8c50c1d431f/tumblr_inline_pqfr3qzBYG1spdppr_500.jpg))**&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5151fc06a4bf2c2cf5886554699f07da/tumblr_inline_pqfr404UNI1spdppr_500.jpg))*******# Next Bump in Pre-Election Year Rally Could Arise in May&gt; As of today’s close, DJIA is up 13.6% year-to-date as of today’s close. S&amp;P 500 is up 16.0% and NASDAQ is at 20.8%. Compared to average pre-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past pre-election year average performance for this point of the year. Aside from a brief excursion on the second trading day of the year, 2019 has largely tracked pre-election year historical performance and then some. Should this trend continue, then the next area of concern is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates. However, should late May weakness materialize, it could prove to be a fair entry point as the market usually rallies through June to mid-July.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3d0279bc7d760cf66137ca9c1882aec/tumblr_inline_pqdpq8LsIl1spdppr_500.jpg))**&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/32fbcbfa3756480792d253680817298d/tumblr_inline_pqdpqrnKh21spdppr_500.jpg))**&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3687b7c287aa27b0252e510eed0456f/tumblr_inline_pqdpqyLleT1spdppr_500.jpg))*******# B.I.G. Tips - Early Earnings Season Analysis&gt; More than 500 stocks have reported their first quarter numbers so far this earnings season, which gives us a pretty large sample size to start analyzing overall trends. Through today, 67% of stocks that have reported this season have beaten bottom-line consensus EPS estimates. That's a strong reading relative to the historical average of roughly 60% going back to 1999 (first chart below).&gt; While the bottom line beat rate is strong, the top line has so far been lacking. As shown in the second chart below, only 53.6% of companies have managed to report stronger than expected revenues this season. This is definitely a concern now that we're already about a quarter of the way through the reporting period. We would note, though, that last season we saw a similar trend as the top-line beat rate started very low before rebounding by the end of the reporting period and actually showing a sequential increase.&gt; On another note, we've seen an interesting shift in guidance compared to the last two quarters. We're also seeing some negative signs when it comes to how stock prices are reacting to earnings reports.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/beatrates0426.png))************# 10 Observations on New Highs&gt; We wrote about the new record high for the S&amp;P 500 Index Wednesday . This is such a big market event we wanted to share some additional thoughts—10 of them in fact—on this market milestone:&gt; The new high secured March 9, 2019, as the 10th anniversary of the bull market. If the S&amp;P 500 hadn’t made a new high before the next bear market, this bull would have ended short of the 10-year mark.&gt; Don’t fear new highs. Historically, buying stocks at all-time highs has been productive over the long term, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. Going back to 1950, the average 12-month gain from a new high for the S&amp;P 500 has been 9.8%, excluding dividends.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dont-fear-record-highs.png?ssl=1))**&gt; When new highs have been more than six months apart, as the last two were, average gains in the S&amp;P 500 historically have been about 12% in the 12 months after the new record.&gt; For those worried that a new high means sub-par long-term returns, consider that the average 5-year annualized gain in the S&amp;P 500 from all-time highs is 9%. For 10 years, it’s a still solid 7.4% (excluding dividends).&gt; History has shown stocks’ strong start to the year could mean further gains down the road. The average rest-of-year gain for the S&amp;P 500 after a double-digit first quarter rally has been 6%.&gt; Global growth is supportive. Owning stocks when economic conditions are improving, as they are in the United States and China in particular, tends to be rewarding.&gt; We don’t think stocks are overvalued. The S&amp;P 500 price-to-earnings ratio (PE) based on consensus analysts’ estimates for the next 12 months is 16.7, very reasonable considering low interest rates and inflation.&gt; Not all the possible good news is priced in. Investors may get more than they expect out of the U.S.-China trade deal, which could boost business confidence and capital investment.Earnings may be a positive catalyst. First-quarter earnings season is off to a good start overall, and we think 2019 expectations are too low.&gt; Sentiment is not overly bullish. Just 33.5% of individual investors are bullish, according to the American Association of Individual Investors. Other sentiment measures we follow are far from euphoric.&gt; Looking ahead, we believe there are enough potential positive catalysts to propel the S&amp;P 500 to our year-end fair value target of 3,000 this year. At the same time, we acknowledge the risks, particularly overseas—Europe faces structural challenges, lackluster growth, and upcoming Brexit hurdles. The possibility of a pickup in volatility against a favorable fundamental backdrop supports our recommended market weight equities allocation.*****# The Waiting Game for Record Highs&gt; The wait is over.&gt; After more than seven months, the S&amp;P 500 Index notched a fresh all-time closing high of 2,933.68 on April 23. To get here, investors have weathered back-and-forth in trade negotiations, a historic government shutdown, unrelenting Brexit headlines, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) U-turn in policy, and signs of a global slowdown.&gt; Fortunately, U.S. stocks have powered through record highs after a prolonged dry spell. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has climbed an average of 12.9% in the 12 months after snapping at least 6-month long record high drought, based on data since 1950.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Climbing-the-wall-of-worry-1.png?ssl=1))**&gt; “It has been a long time since the S&amp;P 500 scored a new high, yet this could actually hint at future gains,” said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The waiting game for record highs may be tough, but it has proven the durability of this bull market based on sound fundamentals.”&gt; Stocks’ rapid rebound this year has been impressive, especially 10 years into the current bull market. The S&amp;P 500 has rallied more than 20% from the December lows amid the Fed’s pause in rate hikes, progress in trade talks, and an uptick in economic data after a soft beginning to 2019.&gt; Historically, when U.S. stocks have gone six months without a record, investors have had to contend with a significantly longer waiting period (and more market volatility). The benchmark has taken an average of 25 months to post new highs in times it hasn’t hit a record within six months.&gt; We’ve maintained that the late-2018 sell-off was overdone, and we see a compelling case for equities near these levels based on sound economic fundamentals. However, the recovery has been arguably a bit fast considering some of the reasons for the decline have yet to be resolved. We think the S&amp;P 500 could eventually move higher and make a run at our 3,000 fair value target, but we wouldn’t be surprised to see volatility pick up over the next few months.*****# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for April 26th, 2019**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 04.28.19**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)*****Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-*****&gt;
