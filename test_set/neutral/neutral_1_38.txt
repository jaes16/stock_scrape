apples price movements? the stock is down over 15% from its ath, after reporting a monster quarter. are they still overvalued? or is now the time to “buy the dip”?of course we know nothing - but i am curious to hear sentiment on this stock. cnbc constantly name drops apple to guests and guests always skip apple and speak on alphabet, fb, or microsoft.are you waiting to purchase?
