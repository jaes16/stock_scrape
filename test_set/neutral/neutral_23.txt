If you haven't heard of streaming music by now, you must be friends with Patrick Star. I feel that the company will provide strong financials, but moving forward, what is their growth strategy? There are already big players in the market with Apple and I don't see how the platform evolves past it's current form. Apple also is key reason for downloads with their AppStore. It's not like this company going public will provide easier access to customers. Please give me your thoughts.EDIT: Nothing like getting downvoted without an explanation.EDIT 2: Maybe they will make a store for music. That could be something, but kind of against the model.
