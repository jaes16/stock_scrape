apple [recently](https://ibb.co/gfqgsjv). by splitting the stock just like [apple](https://ibb.co/d766wl5) has done a number of times, this allows more individual investors to invest in the company, as they will be attracted by the cheaper share price. [amazon](https://ibb.co/xstd5jf) hasn’t done a share split since the dot com era, and it might be time for the company to take advantage of this hot bull market to actually go ahead with something like at least a 5-10:1 split.

so, let’s go a little through the latest quarter [results](https://ibb.co/y8jhwdc) and [guidance](https://ibb.co/mct3t43). the company increased the operating cash flow by more than 55% to over $55b for the latest twelve months, with free cash flow also increasing by $6b, while they managed to avoid significant [dilution](https://ibb.co/6byclhx) of the company, with only 7m additional shares being outstanding.

the net sales also increased 37% in the last quarter to just over $96b, an increase of more than $26b over 2019, which is an insane 36% increase y/y yet again.

this year amazon has also pushed their [prime day](https://ibb.co/1rpqhmv) ahead of schedule, which resulted in the two biggest days ever for third-party small &amp; medium sellers, which saw an increase in sales of over 60% over 2019, even bigger than amazon own retail business.

amazon continues to expand into multiple revenue streams, with the first amazon [fresh](https://ibb.co/9zbqwkm) grocery store opened in california, which is offe

apple split in 2008 as this gold rush. apple has split again and the stock continued to churn, along with tesla right behind it. however,  regardless of what you believe a stock split has nothing to do with the direct performance of stock appreciation and especially today, there is no reason to do one at all. fractional shares are a common offering on every united states brokerage now.

even in a nonfractional trading world. let's say amazon does a 10:1 split. $3,000 into $300. that's great. people that couldn't afford 1 share of amazon now can. if amazon, has quarter over quarter of shit earnings with no growth, that split is not going to carry any weight. yes, more access to buy leads to appreciation, but retail does not move the needle. hedge funds do not give a rip about the price of a stock. they care about discounted cash flows and investment trajectories.

people continually reference apple, one of the most profitable companies of all time, with a generational product that had record qoq and yoy growth as a reason splitting makes sense. there are market cap weight funds, but ignore those sentiments. on a pure dollar for dollar trade. it does not matter if there are 10 shares of a company, 1,000 shares of a company or 1,000,000,000 shares of a company if the reason they got there was due to a split.

autozone is worth over $1,000 a share. ford is worth $9. ford is the more expensive stock at 35b vs 28b with $azo.

berkshire hathaway is worth over $350,000 a share.

apple car and apple tv already sucks. are they just wuss? what are they afraid of in buying successful business like their competitors. 

even though apple is the biggest company right now, thinking long term 10-15 years from now. i actually think when its all set and done, i see amzn and msft to be way bigger companies than aapl. because they have shown risk taking and investing in other companies and successfully vertically integrating that in their business model

&amp;#x200b;

tl;dr

just to be clear, we all know apple is not going anywhere. they are still going to be printing money and growing their business steadily. but i personally don't see them to be on top in future because they are stubborn and not as aggressive.

apple. (don’t say i should invest in any of the 4 reddit short stop stocks)  

so apple. why is apple at ~$135 a stock when other big retail companies like their biggest competitor samsung are way higher. even google is 10x higher. does it have to do with number of stocks available? or the fact they just launched new tech (m1 chip) last year and likely won’t have a big release soon? it does look like apple has had relatively steady growth over the past 2 years.

apple, salesforce, tesla, paypal, and facebook.  the vast majority of it is amazon, where i have 9 shares.  for months i’ve been planning on trimming that position, but since the stock hasn’t been able to hold any relevant gains since june, i’ve been stuck waiting.  assuming that it increases significantly after q4 reporting, i plan on trimming 4-5 shares, and using that money to start new positions.  i feel like it is a good time (maybe slightly late to the party) to add small caps to my portfolio.  since i’m not as literate in small cap stocks as i am large cap stocks, i think that i’m going to go the etf route.  i have been looking into vtwo and iwm.  does anyone have any input on these etf’s?  any other recommendations?  thanks!

apple, tesla, paypal, nautilus, and 2 different etf's). this account is sitting around 20k and i am far less active on it. 

the last account is one i personally set up through sofi.
i created this investment account so that i could personally play around with different stocks and get a feel for how the market works.

i've currently invested about 5k with close to 1.8k in returns.

with my sofi account, i will buy a stock for a few hundred bones, and if it goes up in a week or 2 or 3 i'll keep tabs on it. once it starts to go back down i'll quickly dump all of it to keep my gains. for example, last week i bought about 300 shares of ftft @about 3.75 per, the next day it went all the way to 10.00 then started to go back down. i sold 150 shares at about 8.75 or so to keep about 1.2k or so. on the flip side i bough about 1000 shares of hibs (inverse stock) at 2.11 and its done gone down to like .65 and then reverse split. i've had it for months trying to get a profit back. 

i've been doing this with dozens of different stocks. some big companies, some small penny stocks, and even some mutual funds. i haven't been too close to day trading (buying and selling in the same day over a 4 day period)

but i am curious if this is a good strategy or if i really just need to ride it out? i enjoy checking my sofi account daily and making moves when i see changes....

any advice? or just keep chugging along if i'm making gains..?

edit: a word.

apple ($aapl) is a company with $13.7 billion worth of volume of short sold stock as of 1/15/2021 ([source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/nasdaq/aapl/short-interest/))! this dwarfs $gme so it can be a great squeeze. it's also a good company with tim apple leading it and lots of growth opportunities with the 5g super cycle!

tldr: please for the love of god stop using "x% short" as the basis of your dd. not everything is a short squeeze and probably nothing will ever match gamestop. just because a company has more than 30% of its shares short-sold doesn't make it an amazing value play with short-squeeze potential.

apple is hypothetically on track to triple iphone sales from african countries. i heard something about tesla expanding into india, but i don’t know how much they’re really investing into that.

i have a feeling that developed markets (usa, europe, japan, et cetera) are going to stagnate, at least in comparison to markets in asia, africa, and latin america.

the example that i gave was hypothetical, but in real life what are some american companies that are expecting massive gains from developing economies?

apple, tesla, google, netflix etc have extremely high debt as compared to the biggest corporations of 50 years ago. and nowadays corporations can leverage their debt. 

so, if company x is in 100 billion debt, they can refinance that debt from the loaner and invest the 100 billion.

so now instead of 100 billion debt it's 200 because they invested borrowed money. what happens when you invest borrowed money and the market crashes, except on a massive corporate scale? 

debt is through the roof while investors are manic, no other time in history have investors been as manic now as in the 1920s. 

think about it... roaring 20s: rich got richer poor got poorer 

but that’s just looking at it fundamentally

attached you will find charts of $djx, the first being 1990 to 2020 without the covid crash.

the second is $djx from 1915 to 1945.

in the earlier graph, there was a flash crash followed by about a year of recovery before the bigger crash ensued. now look at the 1990-2020. we just had our covid crash, a year later we're pumping to all time highs. look familiar?

it was a 90% correction when it all came crashing down in the roaring twenties...

apple**

1) apple silicon chips... wowzers. good stuff. but x86 rules the world, so it's going to be a tough slope to climb.

2) privacy focus, taking a stand against the government. this is a good thing, both morally and for customer cred.

3) their trinkets still neat, even if they're starting to feel like they're taking on years... not much innovation or change in sight either

**arguments against apple**

i think apple is just a poor choice right now and for the mid term as well. here are my points.

1) first of all, there are just better tech stocks right now, such as nvidia. so why not bet more on up-and-coming winners instead of buying has-beens like apple? diversification, maybe, but at some point just buy the nasdaq index instead if you want the average.

2) phones are not the big growing business they were years ago (everyone has one already, and no new features are enticing enough, so customers are opting to stick with what they have). this alone has some analysts predicting apple stock will drop 20-30%. and apple's move to wearables has been lukewarm at best (the apple watch remains a mostly useless bauble)

3) the truth is that buying apple right now is buying an apple without steve jobs and with the notch. make of that what you will

4) no steve jobs, again. current ceo whats-his-name is ok, but ain't no steve jobs. his big idea was to make a credit card? pfft.

5) the notch. it's just so wrong in so many ways (this should be my first indictment against apple),

current 5g u.s. networks mostly use low-band wireless spectrum, or airspace, that is slower than high-band spectrum, but more reliable over longer distances. it will likely take years before the massive speed boost phone carriers promise will make augmented reality and real-time cloud gaming seamless.

the fastest speeds touted by carriers are a type of 5g called millimeter wave, or mmwave, that work over shorter distances. verizon communications inc has the largest current mmwave network, available only in limited areas.

although verizon 5g users could connect almost 10 times faster than on sprint and t-mobile, actual average speeds were far lower, according to research firm opensignal's mobile signal experience report in june.

apple-starts-shipping-devices-stores-203514688.html

(bloomberg) -- apple inc. is starting to use its network of retail stores as distribution centers for shipping products to consumers, joining a trend popularized by other retailers.

the cupertino, california-based technology giant has typically shipped devices like iphones, macs, ipads, and accessories from warehouses located across a customer’s region or directly from china. now items that are in stock can be shipped directly to consumers from a network of almost 300 retail stores spread across the u.s. and canada, according to people familiar with the matter.

apple told staff the shift will mean faster delivery times for customers who live further from distribution centers than from stores, according to the people who asked not to be identified discussing internal policies. the products will be shipped through united parcel service inc. in canada and fedex corp. in the u.s. via ground shipping and may be delivered as early as the day after a customer’s order, apple told its staff. the program will apply to customers who live within 100 miles from a store, the people said.

apple (aapl) as the most popular stock held by millennials. apple got bounced from the top spot after holding it for four-straight quarters, says a just-released quarterly analysis from apex clearing, a custody and stock clearing firm. apex studies more than 1.5 million investment accounts held by people aged 31 years old, on average.

and while many might criticize these young investors, they're laughing all the way to the bank. tesla shares are up 409% this year. that blows away the "buy-and-hold" crowd who are up just 6.7% with the s&amp;p 500. tesla even makes apple's 56.6% gain this year look so-so. and millennials are the only major generation to make tesla their top holding. it's no. 2 for generation z and gen x and no. 3 for baby boomers.

millennials are making money on all but two of their top 10 holdings. and not by just a little. the average year-to-date gain on millennials' top 10 holdings is more than 80%. but to put that into perspective: that's even better than s&amp;p 500 component amazon.com's (amzn) 73% rise this year. very few stocks pull that off.

&gt; general electric (ge) and exxon mobil (xom) are the two names that stand out the most. each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as ge and xom over the next ten to twenty years.

apple’s long-awaited launch event for the iphone 12. there were four new models, all 5g capable, as expected, with sizes, features and even timing as anticipated—evidence that apple ￼ is not just the company with the highest market capitalization in the country, but also the leakiest.

but analyst sentiment on apple (ticker: aapl) shares is nonetheless a bit more bullish now than it was before tuesday’s launch. in particular, the analysts note that both verizon ￼ (vz) and at&amp;t ￼ (t) have launched aggressive trade-in campaigns intended to drive new phone sales.

morgan stanley analyst katy huberty repeated her overweight rating on the stock, while lifting her target price to $136, from $130. huberty was urging investors to buy the stock heading into the event, and she remains steadfastly bullish.

“due to store shutdowns and the economic impact of covid-19, iphone replacement cycles have stretched well beyond what we view as a 4-year structural ceiling, causing forward growth to be mis-modeled by the street, in our view,” she wrote in a research note.

the analyst noted that her fiscal 2021 unit forecast for 220 million phones is 4% above the street’s call, “even before considering potential share gains in markets like europe and china where huawei chip supply restrictions are benefiting apple.” prices for the iphone 12, 12 mini, and iphone 11 announced tuesday are all $50 above what she had included in her financial model, “putting upward pressure” on average price assump

apple announced its latest class of iphones on tuesday, but some analysts said the company failed to address a key point: why the average consumer should shell out $1,000 for its top-of-the-line iphone 12 pro model.

apple event in its entirety so that you don’t have to. i’ve written up some of the key takeaways. 

tldr: apple is positioning itself to compete more directly with amazon’s alexa, improving their services user experience with improved device performance, and using pro models to appeal to an enterprise market rather than just device enthusiasts. 

there are basically two major offerings: 

apple speakers 

apple is fully committing to competing with amazon’s alexa and other smart speakers by offering a new homepod mini and leaning into an offering that only they can, namely the cross device functionality like the intercom feature. it's hard to overstate how much more room to deliver apple has vs amazon in this space, especially given their history of super useful cross platform integration. 

the $99 price tag is in line with apple's premium pricing strategy which will help “fend off gross margin compression”. there’s historically been concern that apple's pricing strategy sacrifices accessibility to consumers. that said, apple has a long history of reaping the rewards from an initial device offering and offering a commodity priced product some years later. homepod and the se line are examples of this strategy at work and i wouldn’t be surprised to see the same strategy here in the next year.

apple's new iphone gets largely positive reception:**

* apple (aapl-us ) on tuesday unveiled four new iphone 12 models. while the event was widely previewed and there were relatively few surprises from a specs' standpoint, sell-side commentary still leaned positive. a number of analysts noted that the event further underpinned their expectations for the new models to drive a meaningful upgrade cycle. one of the more upbeat takeaways revolved around lower-than-expected pricing. there was also some positive sentiment surrounding the disclosure that all of the new models will support mmwave and sub-6ghz 5g technology. carrier promotions were also cited as supportive. in addition, a number of firms discussed how the decision to not include headphones or a power adapter likely helps from both an esg and gross margin standpoint.

apple, google, (i’m going to ignore amazon for this example), microsoft.

what do these companies truly own right now?
it’s not just computers, software.

they own the way we communicate. and think of some of the biggest companies before them, at and t (when the landline became popular).

what elon is building right now is not a car company. the starlink project which already has registrations for beta testing in northern regions of the planet will be casting 100mb wifi to remote areas of the world and cities alike. he’s setting up infrastructure to build a “space highway” and how are people going to communicate from earth to the moon, to mars?

this information highway that will essentially be owning the new age of communications. what at and t had, what apple has now. tesla owns that future. 

google literally invests 10% into spacex. and is one of the few ways you can ‘own’ spacex as a retail investor. 

auto manufacturing is a small gimmick. the information highway, battery manufacturing. the way tesla will be an influence on both communications and energy in the future is the most forward thinking brand i currently see in the world today. 

(i’ll be honest i hate on blue origin because of bezos, but he also has a lot of funding too). these are the companies that may make trillion dollar evaluations appear mid cap.

apple to place the google search engine as the default for iphones.

&gt; the agency will argue that google, which controls about 80 percent of search queries in the united states, struck agreements with phone makers using alphabet’s android operating system to pre-load the search engine on their phones and make it hard for rival search engines to become a replacement. by using contracts to maintain its monopoly, competition and innovation has suffered, the suit with argue.

&gt; the suit reflects the pushback against the power of the nation’s largest corporations, and especially technology giants like google, amazon, facebook and apple. conservatives like president trump and liberals like senator elizabeth warren have been highly critical of the concentration of power in a handful of tech behemoths.

&gt; attorney general william p. barr, who was appointed by mr. trump, has played an unusually active role in the investigation. he pushed career justice department attorneys to bring the case by the end of september, prompting pushback from lawyers who wanted more time and complained of political influence. mr. barr has spoken publicly about the inquiry for months and set tight deadlines for the prosecutors leading the effort.

apple on monday and started profiting the first day (around $300). although it went down a little tuesday i’m still in the green. but the call doesn’t end til the 30th. i know no one knows for sure, but what will the stock price be for apple around the 30th? i know earnings is coming soon also, if that matters. i can hold this call longer but i was just wondering how high will it go because i was surprised to be up so much in profit the first day.

apple analysis. there were between 7 million and 9 million pre-orders of the iphone 12 and iphone 12 pro globally during the first weekend of sales, according to kuo.

the new iphones have also proven to be a hot commodity on chinese e-commerce sites. the available stock on jd.com sold out within 30 seconds after pre-orders started on october 16. and alibaba, the parent company of the south china morning post, said that about 30 million users have searched for the new iphones over the last 30 days on its tmall marketplace. that is twice the search volume for the iphone 11 in the same period last year.

sales of the iphone 12 could be aided by the fact that it is the first iphone to support 5g after apple skipped the feature last year. sales of the iphone 12 and 12 pro reached an estimated 1.7 to 2 million units globally in the first 24 hours of pre-orders. the three iphone 11 models only saw 500,000 to 800,000 units sold in the same period after pre-orders opened in september last year, according to the report from kuo.

apple ￼, as the final quarter without any contribution to earnings from the newly unveiled iphone 12 lineup. investors are focused on demand for the new phones, but the results may still yield some surprises.

wall street is busily tweaking its numbers, resulting in a flurry of monday research notes, before the figures come out late on thursday. the consensus forecast is for revenue of $64.2 billion and per-share profits of 71 cents.

atlantic equities analyst ianjit bhatti on monday assumed coverage of apple (ticker: aapl) from one of his colleagues, lifting the firm’s rating to overweight from underweight, and setting a price target of $150. at the heart of his call is the idea that it would be a mistake to value apple like just another tech company.

“having created an enduring premium consumer electronics brand, we believe that apple’s product business should be valued in line with other premium and luxury consumer stocks, rather than traditional computer peers,” bhatti writes. “apple’s focus on delivering superior user experiences through design, enabled by its unsurpassed silicon to software design capabilities, has resulted in a premium product positioning, differentiating apple against computing peers.”

citi’s jim suva sees potential upside to consensus estimates driven by ipads, macs and wearables, saying “work from home and stay at home trends continued to drive [an] uptick in consumer tech spending during the quarter.” he sees a promising hint in a recent strong e

apple-netflix-discussed-acquiring-bond-231130830.html

(bloomberg) -- metro-goldwyn-mayer inc. held discussions with apple inc. and netflix inc. about taking its new james bond film directly to streaming, according to people familiar with the situation, but the studio says it’s committed to a theatrical release.

the film, “no time to die,” could fetch hundreds of millions of dollars in a potential streaming sale, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private. mgm declined to comment on any talks, but said the film “is not for sale.”

nabbing the rights to “no time to die,” would have been a major coup for a streaming service and could have helped entice subscribers looking to watch the latest bond movie. the daniel craig film, which cost about $250 million to produce, would be the most notable movie to switch to streaming due to the pandemic, though other films have taken a similar route.

apple ￼ appears to be seeing strong early demand for the new iphone 12 pro, with significant wait times for delivery in all areas. apple introduced the new 5g-compatible iphone 12 lineup last week.

credit suisse analyst matthew cabral writes in a research note that as of monday—four days before consumers can actually get the new apple (ticker: aapl) phones—preorders look similar to those at the same point in the iphone 11 cycle. wait times are longer for the iphone 12 pro than the flagship iphone 12 in all markets, “fitting the pattern of higher-end users more likely to buy early in the launch cycle,” cabral says.

iphone 12 pro demand appears highest in asia, he notes, where wait times exceed three weeks on most models in both japan and hong kong, with waits of two to three weeks in china, one to three weeks in europe, and less than two weeks in the u.s. he says iphone 12 base model lead times are less than a week in the u.s., while wait times in canada, japan, and hong kong are running one to two weeks. color options to not appear to be impacting wait times, he adds.

cabral’s findings are consistent with a report yesterday from taiwan-based analyst ming-chi kuo of tf international securities, who noted stronger-than-expected demand for the iphone 12 pro, with high levels of demand in china.

apple began taking orders for the iphone 12 and iphone 12 pro last friday, for delivery starting this friday. both have 6.1-inch displays. buyers can preorder both the 5.4-inch iphone

apple-buys-vilynx-video-artificial-intelligence-startup-50-million-2020-10

apple added to its rapidly growing artificial intelligence portfolio earlier this year by acquiring spain-based ai video startup vilynx for approximately $50 million, bloomberg reported tuesday.

vilynx, headquartered in barcelona, built software that leverages computer vision to analyze a video's visual, text, and audio content with the goal of "understanding" what's in the video, which helps it categorize and tag metadata, generate automated video previews, and recommend related content, according to an earlier version of its website.

apple has made significant inroads in the ai space over the past few months, acquiring uk-based spectral edge last december, seattle-based xnor.ai for $200 million in january, and voysis and inductiv in april and may to help it improve siri. apple has a habit of quietly purchasing smaller companies. in 2018, ceo tim cook said in interview that the company had bought 20 companies over a six-month span, while only six were public knowledge.

* mmm - 3m - king
* t - at&amp;t - champion

and so on, many of these companies are ones we all recognize because they are so well established have have very wide markets. they have incredible staying power for these reasons, often having enough money to expand into new markets by buying up new companies or just allocating free capital to the sectors. 

# how to evaluate the companies for this strategy:

since the focus of this investing is less on capital appreciation and more on the dividend growth we need to evaluate the following factors:

* dividend payout ratio:
   * payout less than 50% of its earnings in the form of dividends is generally considered stable
   * the company has the potential to raise its earnings over the long term. 
*  free cash flow to equity:
   * this is simply what is paid out after expenses and debts have been paid. if a company has too much debt it can affect their ability to continue paying out and increasing their dividends.
*  debt to ebitda ratio (earnings before interest depreciation and amortization)
   * a company with a lower ratio, when compared to similar companies, is more attractive. see at&amp;t vs verizon!
* **high dividend yield are not the focus and can often signal an unsustainable payout! look for companies in the healthier 3-6% range. (do research after thi

apple ￼, amazon.com ￼, alphabet ￼, facebook ￼, and twitter ￼—beat expectations for both sales and profits. but there were more revealing details to be found beneath the headlines.

waiting for 5g: let’s start with apple (ticker: aapl), still the largest company on earth by market capitalization, but now worth less than $2 trillion as its shares have fallen 20% from their 2000 high. this was an awkward quarter for apple. investors are buzzed about the new iphone 12 line, but the phones have just started shipping, and weren’t available in the september quarter. apple ceo tim cook said iphone sales in the quarter beat internal expectations, but they were a little shy of wall street consensus estimates. worrisome was a sharp drop in sales in “greater china.” they fell 29% from a year ago. the apparent issue: china is ahead of the u.s. on 5g, and other phone makers already have 5g phones on the market. would you buy a 4g phone now? didn’t think so.

apple didn’t give formal guidance, but it gave some solid hints. it expects iphone sales to rise year over year, despite the late start for the new iphones, with double-digit revenue growth for every other hardware line and services. apple also expects a return to growth in china. and, by the way: macs, ipads, and wearables together generated almost $24 billion in sales in the quarter, up a combined 30% year over year. on a run-rate basis, apple’s non-iphone hardware this quarter will surpass $100 billion. services is approaching $60 b

i decided for those shares because these are really the only ones i know that i “believe” in and most of these are bigger names around the world. furthermore the idea was to keep investing 1k/2 months until end of 2021 (evenly distributed across all shares) and then letting it sit for at least until 2023. what are your thoughts, would you advise to keep away from any of those mentioned above?

apple has fallen hard lately even having good results and a new green-friendly philosophy. (great triple bottom line)

i feel like 108 is a good price, and it might drop monday a little more (i’m expecting 105-103 but don’t quote me i don’t know anything).

last week, i took 80% of my shares out of the market. and am hesitating to go and throw all of that in apple. 

if it doesn’t work on the short term, i don’t mind waiting until 2023 for it to go back up.

what would you do in my situation? go for another company?

apple (aapl), amazon (amzn) alphabet (goog, googl), and facebook (fb) reported their quarterly earnings. though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except alphabet) pulled back steeply today. after the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. in other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. the earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterday’s issue of the daily recap. 

today, the federal reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its main street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that “fees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans”. demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity. as many pundits have pointed out, many small- and mid-sized businesses have stayed on the sidelines from taking on more loans that they would eventually need to pay back during the pandemic.

unfortunately, according to data from johns hopkins university, there were 88,521 new coronavirus infections reported in the us yesterday, another record, and 9,540 more cases than were reported wednesday. the trend this week is worrying, given that only last friday, the us set its previous record for daily new infe

apple tv+ (aapl) are steals at $6.99 and $4.99 a month, respectively.

according to a new poll conducted by staples, which surveyed 1,000 consumers across all age groups, 60% of respondents said they currently pay for one or more streaming service — plus a cable subscription.

meanwhile, 46% cited netflix as the one streaming platform for which they’d cancel a cable subscription. that figure far surpassed its competitors, although it seems like that won’t happen for quite some time with nearly 50% of respondents saying they have no plans to cut the cord this year during covid-19.

apple (used my money to buy shares, then used as much margin as i could using questrades' money since the margin requirement was only 30%). problem is, i went all in at $125 (this was around mid october btw.

anyways, i just got margin called by $7,000. only thing is, i don't have the money to pay up. i am a 19 year old college student with no job, and no assets that debtors can go for. can i just declare bankruptcy and get the loss written off? my best friend uses the adage, "if you owe me $70, you have a problem. if you owe me $7,000 i have a problem". but seriously, i have 0 assets to my name, what could they possibly take other than the cash in my account why is already negative because apple buttfucked me.

once again, not a shitpost, i'm just pissed off at myself for a) using margin, b)buying at the top. throwaway account because my actual reddit account has my name on it and don't want it to be used in case this goes to legal proceedings.

p.s. i live in canada, but even if you have american expertise in this area, i would love to hear anyways.

**conclusion**

i’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being asml. i saw the potential of asml getting a monopolistic position in the euv technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. asml doesn’t have the same potential anymore as amd has now. especially since amd is still trading at the same levels after their q2 update. i shifted my portfolio more towards amd, and i am suggesting you do the same.

amd: 3,000 shares, 6,500 lt warrants.

apple (aapl) has gained the most in market cap since trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! amazingly, both amazon (amzn) and microsoft (msft) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, aapl, amzn, and msft have gained that much in the last four years.

apple cash that i accrue from my apple card purchases at the end of the month and i put this into my portfolio. my question is until i have steady income again should i buy fractional shares of something like apple each month? is there something else or something better i should put this in (something maybe under 20)? maybe something like american airlines or something travel related (purely mentioning them over delta because i can grab more of them)?

currently i have (5 yr growth %): 
apple: 4 (+295%)
amd: 2 (+3931%)
fastly: 1 (+358%)
qcln: 1 (+262%)
nio: 1 (+593%)
workhorse: 7 (+191%)

i only gather like $20-30 a month so i don’t think it’d be worth spreading that over multiple stocks. i want to just put it into something and forget about it. i’m really new and i tried day trading and that’s just not for me i’d rather see steady long(ish) term growth and not stress about dips when they happen. 

any help/suggestions are appreciated!

the analyst said that his recent asia checks this week have been incrementally bullish around iphone 12 demand both domestically and in china.

the pro max model is also seeing very strong demand out of the gates, ives said, which bodes well for average selling prices (asp's) heading into fiscal year 2021 for apple on the iphone 12.

the biggest gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/t8npw6w) yesterday were communications, financials and technology with most sectors being in the green, except industrial, as the laggards from yesterday were small cap growth companies and especially those from china, like nio, alibaba and others, that have suffered from the recent news that the us is looking to delist some of them if they do not meet new standards.

apple as you can see in this [heat map](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.

here are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yv5rq23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the markit pmi and the ism index with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [salesforce](https://ibb.co/ytk19tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy slack in a cash-only deal. salesforce is expected to maintain its eps flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. i fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. if they manage to buy slack that will be a very positive thing for the company’s future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the microsoft bundle. [slack news](https://ibb.co/grjm1wk)

great news came in the early morning today, as the oecd [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) it’s gdp contraction up 0,3% with a real gdp growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as china is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a gdp growth of 8% next year.

also, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, tesla saw it’s shares bounce back after the

apple stocks widget on my phone as it is easiest, but it doesn't usually have a lot of info. maybe an article a week or something for certain stocks.

of course if i'm really curious i'll start googling and checking carious sites, but it'd be great if i could get all my news in one place.

anyone have a better system?

apple, but i also have a diversified etf in my domestic portfolio. i followed charlie munger's 3-stock portfolio principle that's why i just want to keep everything simple.

right now, i'm planning to add one stock in my us portfolio to serve as my core. i'm planning to invest in brk-b but since warren buffet and charlie munger are in their 90s, their pass is my concern with the company. i'm confident that they built a great team to handle the company when their time comes. my other option is to invest in spy and call it a day.

is it still a good time to buy brk-b?

do you think their pass matters when investing in their company for the long-term?

what are your other thoughts?

ps: wish i can buy both but my cash is limited since td ameritrade doesn't buy fractional shares.

apple, is there anybody that doesn’t know this company? they are the biggest company in the world and they continue to expand with new products and services every day, i don’t see this company going down in the short term or the long term as they have pretty expensive at a 35 p/e but earnings are still rising especially with more subscription based income coming in with the release of the apple one bundle.

apple as they released their streaming services, however, hbo max is reported to have \~38 million subscribers at this point in time, which is ahead of their previous timeframe predictions. their stated goals are to have over 50 million domestic subscribers by 2025, and increase the subscription revenue to over $5 billion by that time. 

in addition to this, warner is planning to aggressively push its streaming service in 2021 by releasing every single one of its movies on hbo max. this move is definitely putting at&amp;t on the offensive and many are awaiting to see the response from netflix and disney will be. warner does still have agreements with amc, however over the decade theaters as a whole have been on the decline. this just highlights how significant the move into streaming by disney and at&amp;t have been. yes at&amp;t was late to the party, but they have their slice of the pie and warner media produces tons of movies and entertainment, it will likely continue to have a significant impact to the company's profitability as streaming becomes more and more favorable over theaters and traditional cable. 

there is a lot more to the time warner and hbo piece that will not be touched on here, please do your own research to supplement these points. 

# let's take a look at the dividend and price/value, and growth:

the at&amp;t is a dividend aristocrat, its dividend has been paid continuously since 1881 and increased for 36 consecutive years.

apple aapl , at this point, as the only other company in that lofty realm.

“elon has recently said that 30% to 40% of the value of the car could be in insurance,” the wall street vet went on to explain. “what that means is that they can start offering their own insurance and improve margins. that’s high-margin revenue.”

“i would not invest in tesla based on that, but the concept that this company is going to continue to evolve and be a tech leader in the next decade, i’m on board with that,” he said.

apple and the new airpods max? should we buy airbnb or doordash when they launch tomorrow? let’s talk about this and more about the stock market**

hey everyone and good morning! so, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [nasdaq composite](https://ibb.co/8zqq165) leading the way up half a percent, the [sp500](https://ibb.co/9pfmq0x) up .28%, both of them closing at new record highs with the [dow jones](https://ibb.co/bbsbdqm) also up .35% to close tuesday. the [vix](https://ibb.co/5mpvynn) also showed a steady decline through the day as it dropped almost 3%. this moves in the market were caused by the [latest](https://ibb.co/lnr5q3x) hopes for a stimulus deal to be agreed on by the end of current session in congress as there seems to be a lot of ground on which parties can agree on. things have gotten worse in the economy since this hole stimulus talk has been going around, so, if both parties would have been more willing to give up some ground, people would have already gotten more support and we would probably be talking about other bills or measures that would have helped even more. so, maybe this [latest](https://ibb.co/w4lybk9) mnuchin proposal with maybe minor tweaks would be the best chance of anything happening by the end of this year.

we saw more companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/r9n61kk) as over 3 thousand companies were moving up, continuing the huge bull run started in november as more than 84% of companies are moving above the 50 and

apple. before this, i was only invested in about $600 and wasn’t making a lot of profit. 


now i have made $66 in the past hour, and i’m getting more profit since i’ve invested a bit more than i was. of course this will fluctuate, but this lead me to wondering how people make a living off buying stocks? my plan was to buy and hold. 



to make a living, do you buy them pre market when they’re really cheap then sell when they reach a max? 



do you work with a firm so you are given x amount of money to invest? 


how would one survive on this? 



i’m imagining that someone buys them when they’re really cheap, sells when really high and then takes the profit so they can live comfortably, then the rest all goes back into stock? 


as an average person who doesn’t have $10k+ laying around to invest, is it possible to make a living off stocks? 



i’m very new to this and any explanation would be appreciated. thanks all.

apple in march crash actually i have built my portfolio (core) back then, but i have a problem or maybe it's not a problem i will find out i guess. i have allocated 6.55% of my portfolio to apple, and it had now grown so much that its 10,31% of my overall portfolio value. so my question is first is that problem when your portfolio gets overshadowed by 1 company and when is the right time to trim down position and what would be healthy portfolio value(allocation) of 1 stock 10%, 8%, 5%?

tesla should sell each car around 1.3 million dollars right now to justify it's price.

that means stop being delusional and try to find excuses for tesla. ride the hype, but don't try and make sense saying it's justified it's current price.
