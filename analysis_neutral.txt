Would presume over the last 3 to 4 years the losses of those betting against Tesla would be much higher than 38 billion.Also over the last year, anyone betting against the FAANG+M stocks would have been decimated.So why is the Popular Meme stock so important? If Apple market cap goes down 1 percent it probably same loss as the shorts had against the popular stock.Edit: thanks for all the replies and insight. Much appreciated.
Over the last couple of weeks, there have been dozens of posts deliberating whether or not to sell growth/tech stocks that have been dropping recently and switch over to "re-opening" or value plays. The key take away here has to be this:If a 10% drop in a stock makes you wonder whether or not you should sell that stock, you should have never bought that stock in the first place.Contrary to popular belief, stocks do not always go up. In fact, most stocks fail to beat the market in the long-term, with few exceptions. Buffet makes this clear. A good stock is not considered good just because it may do well in the next year, or because it has shown growth in the past. It is only a good buy if it has value beyond a short-term horizon, and most importantly, IF YOU BUY AT THE RIGHT PRICE. If you had bought GE at its peak, a company that is invested in all aspects of life and won't ever disappear, you would be down nearly 75%. Why is this? Is GE a bad company, with bad products, or a shrinking customer base? No, you would have just bought in at a price that was unjustifiable. Think of this scenario, you are the owner of a snack shop. Summer is coming up, so you decide to invest in significant inventory of ice cream. After all, people will purchase frozen desserts in the hot summer days, right? This can't possibly bad investment. So you go to your supplier, and he offers you a price of $100 per pint of ice-cream. What would you do? Would you buy just because ice-cream is guaranteed to sell in the future? No, not unless customers were willing to pay more than $100 per pint.Conversely, your next-door competitor decides to invest in inventory of hot chocolate. This is ridiculous to you, who would buy hot chocolate in the summer? However, your neighbor buys in at $0.10 per cup of hot chocolate for his supply. Once summer is over, you sell out of your inventory, but at a loss because no one is willing to buy ice cream at more than $10 a pint. Then winter comes, and guess who profits more?The point here is that being right about a trend is not enough if the price you buy in at is not the right one. If your belief in a stock is rattled because it drops a little bit, you did not believe in the price in the first place. If this scares you enough, you are better off sticking to index funds and filtering out the noise. There is nothing wrong with that, picking stocks is hard, and there is no guarantee that you will come out on top.My two cents is this: lumping tech into one single asset class is absurd, and calling companies like Amazon and Microsoft "growth" stocks is disingenuous if you lump in Palantir and Tesla in that same category. The market right now is doing just that, however, in the sense that high-PE growth stocks like Tesla are dropping alongside with Apple. In my opinion, all this is doing in the long-run is that you are buying tried-and-true blue chips at a discount.Kohl's is not going to be larger in 10 years than it is now, and its price now does not make it a good buy.  Conversely, just because Tesla will be huge in the future does not mean that buying it at a PE of 1000+ is a wise investment. Re-opening plays are just market chatter. Cruise lines have tremendous debt, banks are tied to risky-credit loans and government regulation, and oil companies are at the mercy of an overseas oil cartel. Just because they are outperforming now, does not mean they will be a good buy if the current price does not reflect their value in the long-term.Buy into valuable companies (future growth, good price) at a discount, ignore short-term market sentiment, and invest in index funds if you do not feel strong enough convictions in your stock picks.
**Current Conditions of the Market:**Let me be clear: this is not the typical conditions of the market where stocks fluctuate double and triple digit percentages per day. There’s a place for that - the casino. In recent weeks, herds of new traders are pouring into the trading scene hoping to get a piece of the volatile market that has turned the rags to riches, or the other way around. The stock market as a whole, under normal conditions, moves gradually in both directions, guided by trends, innovation, speculation, earnings report, and financial changes. What we are in right now is a hysteria-filled environment that is risky for both veteran traders and novices. Any uninformed, reckless decision can produce different results - by chance. Be wise and do not let chance underlie your success or bankruptcy stories. Please do your research first before investing into anything and whatever you do, do not make the mistake of over-extending yourself with margin (brokerage-provided capital) that you cannot repay should things go south. People have and continue to make this fundamental mistake that will ruin them financially for years. Stock investments should be about long-term growth, stability, and supplemental to your income. Investments should give you access to the opportunity of financial freedom, but should not be your primary source for income. Do not listen to stock gurus and paid-only discord groups - they don’t make money from stocks, they make money from you. Lastly, this atypical market condition is the perfect storm for spontaneous “pump and dumps” where stocks become inflated, and based on fool’s theory or musical chairs (whichever you prefer), the last one that gets out gets burned. Be smart, be patient, do the research. **Basic Stock Jargons &amp; Short/Long Positions:***Long* \- you’re buying and holding a stock with the intention for it to increase in value.*Short* \- you’re borrowing shares from a lender (brokerage, investment firm, individual investors), selling it to someone, and hoping to buy it back at a lower price. Your profit is the difference in the sell and buy back price. I’ll provide a real world example because this concept it a bit more complex:* Person A is a share lender. They want to lend the share and get paid a small interest rate as compensation.* Person B asks Person A to lend him that share temporarily. Person B does not pay anything upfront, but he promises to pay Person A in the form of interest over time.* Person B finds a buyer Person C. Person C wants to buy a stock so it can go up. Person C is “long” on this stock. Person B, however, is short on this stock because he wants the value of the stock to go down.* Person C pays Person B $10 for the stock. Now, Person C has spent $10, and Person B has gained $10. * Two hypothetical situation happens now:   * Scenario 1: Stock value increases to $15. Person C is now up $5 and he sells because he’s making nice gains. Person B needs to buy back that share at $15, but he only gained $10 profit initially. Now he needs to fork up $5 to buy back the share, and then return the share back to the lender + any interest accrued. In this scenario, the “short” lost money, the “long” gained money, and the “lender” made interest money.    * Scenario 2: Stock value decreases to $5. Person C is now down $5 and he sells to cut losses. Person B needs to buy back that share at $5, but he already has $10 in profit initially. Now he pays $5 for the share, leaving him still with $5 profit, and returns the share back to the lender + any interested accrued. In this scenario, the “short” made money, the “long” lost money, and the “lender” made interest money. * The above scenarios help to show why “shorts” (typically hedge funds or experienced traders) might want to manipulate the stock price to go down. Hedge funds have an incredible amount of power in the market, which I will explain in a bit, and can often create serious price movements to invoke price action that benefits themselves. Shorts, therefore, have the opposite intention of longs. They want share prices to go down, and in the process, can bankrupt certain companies that rely on the stock market liquidity to stay afloat. In other words, when investors leave a stock because it is dropping in value, the company loses that money that they could have used to pay off debt, grow the business, develop new products, pay for expenses, etc. **Market Manipulation:**Market manipulation is not new to the scene. Investors have long known of the existence of stock market manipulation tactics, and every day, we may observe some levels of manipulation in specific stocks, specific categories or industries of stocks, or the entire market. Market manipulation is defined as any actions performed with the intention of moving a certain stock price in favor of the manipulator. In this case, these are the wealthy “whales” or hedge funds, both of which have enormous capital capable of shifting stock prices at alarming speeds. Keep in mind, not all hedge funds do this and not all hedge funds are “shorts”. Some are “neutral” and act as lenders to make money, some are “growth-based” and invest just like everyday traders with the intention of raising share prices, and others are “short” which are probably perceived to be the sadistic groups of the bunch. Below, I will be discussing how manipulation occurs and on different scales.**Manipulation Tactics on a Spectrum:**Market manipulation can happen in certain stock, sectors, or the entire market. There are probably far more types of manipulative tactics than we know, but I will describe the most basic types and the strategies behind it.*Scenario 1:*Let’s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. Hedge funds are not too excited about this increased share value, so they can “hedge” or protect themselves, by selling put options. When they sell puts, they are anticipating that the stock will continue to surge, which causes the puts to become worthless at expiration, but on the contrary, they will be collecting the “premium” or money paid upfront by traders that bought the put. At the same time, this hedge fund will slowly “cover”, or buy shares of Stock X, so that the increased value of the shares will offset the short position which is losing money. The manipulation here is by using the sheer amount of capital in hand to bolster the stock, both creating favorable conditions for the puts that they sold and the share that they purchased as cover. If they want to add another level of manipulation to this, they can also purchase call options, which will result in profit if the stock price goes up. In this scenario, hedge funds make money at the expense of put option buyers and other shorts that do not have manipulative power or capital to recreate this same strategy.*Scenario 2:*Let’s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on Stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. This hedge fund does not want to risk extra capital to cover their short position (by buying shares, selling put options, or buying call options), so they try a different route. Keep in mind that hedge funds are typically heavily invested in many stocks and assets, meaning they have a lot of power in deciding the direction of many stocks that have potential to instill widespread fear across the entire market if it drops. Take for example, if Apple and Google began to hurl downwards, this can create panic in the market where everyday traders might sell their shares at a loss. This in turn might ripple through the market as other investors in other stocks are predicting a downward trajectory across the market since these big name stocks are losing value so rapidly. Conveniently enough, hedge funds own a lot of these big name “FANG” stocks. If I am a moderately sadistic hedge fund, I can sell off a large holding of shares (in the scale of multi millions or billions) that are in the same sector as Stock X, which would incite fear across the sector, creating panic sell offs. The price will drop sharply across the board, including Stock X, and the short position will produce big profits. Because this hedge fund sold off a large chunk of their shares at a good price, they can now cover their short position (essentially getting rid of it), and then buy up these same stocks that were let go earlier, only this time at a much cheaper price. The hedge fund has now made money not only on the short position, but now they got into the stock at a cheap price in which they can explore other manipulative tactics to bolster the price again. This can be done by encouraging analyst upgrades, publicizing “newly” purchased positions without disclosing the fact that they previously owned it, etc. *Scenario 3:*This one involves technology: algorithm trading (commonly referred to as algo trading). This one is a really intricately designed manipulative tactic that investors really have no way of getting around. Algorithm trading is the process of using high-speed super-computers and a team of traders to constantly monitor market activity and trade when opportunities arise. In this case, the hedge funds do not have to do any direct manipulation of the market, which makes this 100% legal. How this works is by taking advantage of how trading works and the time it takes for a trade to be made. For you general investors, we have mobile apps and web-based trading platforms to trade. When we like a stock, we have to go through the motion of inputting the stock ticker symbol, the amount of shares, the price we are willing to pay, hit submit, and confirm the trade. For hedge funds using algorithm trading, all this is done autonomously, which makes submission of an order several magnitudes quicker. When an order is submitted, it goes through a brokerage (Fidelity, Webull, ETrade, TDA, RH, etc.) and the data is rerouted to a clearing house (intermediate party that verifies and processes the trade). Clearing houses are responsible for making sure your orders are filled, but they take it on a first come first serve basis. So if a stock is moving quickly, hedge funds have a serious edge in getting in cheaper and faster as well as getting out higher and faster. Algorithm trading is integratable as part of the buying and selling strategies mentioned in the two previous scenarios, which is why they can almost guarantee profit. Algorithm trading also uses a lot of data in their backbone to determine the trades that have a high chance of profitability, and it acts on various factors such as volatility, volume, interest activity, news, etc. In some cases, these algorithms can be set to do some extremely sadistic things. I’ll start by talking about “market orders” vs “limit orders”. Before you make a trade on your brokerage, you will notice an option that says “market order” or “limit order”. Market orders are an agreement that you will purchase the stock or option contract at the best price in the market in the momentary space in time. There is of course a huge risk to that because in that short moment in time, there may not be anyone selling at a good price, and instead, some people might set sell limits at ridiculous prices. For example, some people set a sell limit at $1000 for GME. If you did a market order, and you get really unlucky, you might end up snagging a share for $1000 each, when the actual share value might be $300. However, when you set a “limit order”, you are agreeing to buy a share at a maximum price that you designated. In the event that a hedge fund siphons a ton of shares of a company, the algorithm can be set to sell these shares at a ridiculous sell limit. Remember, when they buy or sell, it’s processed significantly faster at the clearing houses, so if you’re that one unlucky trader that went for a market order on a stock, you might end up purchasing it at a huge premium set by the hedge funds themselves. Moral of the story: DO NOT PURCHASE AS MARKET ORDER - ALWAYS PURCHASE AT LIMIT ORDER. I’m am not a financial advisor, so take everything I said as gibberish.

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/20/netflix-ceo-hastings-tough-competition-from-apple-disney-coming.htmlIn an interview with Variety, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings admitted that it’s a “whole new world starting in November,” with the launch of Apple TV+, Disney+ and other new streaming services.He believes Netflix can still win by sticking to its tried and true strategy of binge-able content.However, Hastings revealed Netflix lost out on the rights to Amazon’s hit comedy “Fleabag.”
Now these are just 10 that I think will be pretty big. There are going to be others that will go public in 2018 (I saw that Aston Martin is planning to go public soon at a similar valuation to Ferrari - Ticket $RACE) and some may not go public this year, but may get delayed to 2019, or 2020... or may never go public. Please add any companies you are watching to go public in 2018 in the comments so we can look into them as well. If you want to watch the video where I go more in depth on each pick, here it is: https://youtu.be/zJQagRBjDCk* 1: Spotify - Spotify is a company that has a dominance in the music streaming space, and competes with companies like Pandora, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Google Music, but has still managed to be the #1 choice for consumers. in 2018, we will most likely see this company go public. I can see them being the Netflix of music - and eventually become their own label (like original content)* 2: Uber - Popular ride sharing app that is used around the world and most people know about the company and use it regularly as well. Strong rumours that this will indeed go public in 2018, but this was also rumoured in 2017. They are valued at somewhere between 60-70B.* 3: Lyft - Competitor to Uber and also a ridesharing app. Not as big as uber around the world however the most enticing part of this company is that they have Alphabet is an investor (I believe a 1B investment from Alphabet). They are valued at somewhere between 10-15B.* 4: Avaya - Hardware company, transforming to a software and services company. They are big in the UC space, and Contact Center space as well. Main competitors are Cisco and Mitel in the same space. Recently came out of Chapter 11, and not quite sure on their valuation when they will go public.* 5: Xiaomi - This is a chinese company who primarily makes smartphones and related electronics (power banks, accessories, etc.). They are making waves in China and is a good competitor to Huawei in China. If they go public in 2018, they will come in at around a 50B valuation.* 6: Airbnb - This is a popular app for travelers. It allows you to rent out your house or room to earn a bit more income whenever you are on vacation, or if you have extra space in your house being unused. The prices are typically cheaper than hotels and I personally used it, for example for cottage rentals with friends, or when we traveled to Japan. Airbnb is great when you can't find a Hotel in a rural area, or if you want to stay in the heart of the city for cheaper than a hotel (typically). They are currently valued at 30-40B.* 7: Dropbox - They allow you to upload and share files with others online. They are essentially cloud storage, and was one of the first ones to do this before others got in the game (Apple, Google, etc.). Think of it as a hard drive that is hosted by Dropbox, and you can upload and download files from there at any time, share the files with friends, etc. Dropbox is currently valued at 10B in 2014, not sure where it's at now, but if I had to guess, I'd say 15-20B.* 8: Ancestry.com - Allows you to see your family tree. I've never used it personally, but they claim to have over 7B records from US, Canada, Europe. They offer a free trial if you're curious about family roots, so could check it out and see if you want to subscribe to their service (I personally would never...). Currently valued at around 3B.* 9: Zscaler - Cloud and security company that provides firewalls, antivirus, SSL, and anything required in keeping a secure connection. They are big in the enterprise space and have a good presence in the industry for security. Currently only valued at 1B which may be a pretty good deal for a company that provides good value.* 10: Pinterest - They are essentially a Social network. It's idea is for images and to save images to view later. For example, my wife used it before the wedding and would add different hairstyle ideas in there. She could go on google images and when she sees one she likes, there's a button to add to Pinterest. Then you have all of these pictures in 1 spot later to compare and view. The company is currently valued at around 12-13B.Share what companies you are watching to go public in 2018, and let us know if you plan to invest in any of these 10 if they do go public this year. Don't forget to Invest Positively and Happy Investing!
I'm asking because its easy to say "I should have invested company X years ago" in hindsight but its another thing to invest in something that hasn't yet proven itself a reputable company. What made these companies worth the risk at the time?
I'm in need of some investment advice. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask or not, but I know one of the rules of investment is to not place all your eggs in one basket. Does anyone have any strong opinions on if/how I should diversify this?
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/10/netflix-nflx-will-weather-streaming-threats-goldman.htmlIn a note to clients on Thursday, Goldman Sachs analysts say Netflix’s long history of competition should help it weather the streaming wars.Netflix investors fear the company could lose ground to the bevy of streaming services due to launch from the likes of Apple, Disney and HBO.Netflix faces growing fears that it could lose out in the streaming wars, but Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients on Thursday that the company has fought off competition before, making it likely to weather the storm. But Goldman cut its its 12-month target price from $420 to $360 anyway, citing long-term pressures to subscriber growth and margins. The stock currently trades at $274, up more than 2% on Thursday morning.

Full stock list: https://i.imgur.com/DgmNfSI.png (including some losers)The first position I bought was Facebook in 2013. Back when they couldn't monetize mobile and their users were leaving in droves and they bought that service called Instagram for 1B. I could not wait to buy in since they dominated social media and figured they would turn it around.The second position I bought was Disney in Feb 2014. I forget why they were struggling, but I looked at their 52 week chart and it seemed like a bargain at $74. It is one of the few non-tech stocks I bought.Over the next 6 to 18 months I bought the majority of my tech stocks when they were doing horribly and the buzz about them was horrible.  One of the last positions I got into was Apple.At one point I was down 20+% on all of my investments for months and basically just kept buying more when I was down a lot (20%+) on a specific stock that I believed in.  A good example is Amazon. (Another stock that I've done that with that hasn't turned out well is Under Armor.)Don't get me wrong, I was nervous the entire time I was buying and had no idea how things would turn out. I just bought stocks I believed in and figured time would tell.My strategy is basically sticking to the field I know well and try to buy market leaders at a good bargain compared to their historical highs. It could be that I just got lucky. I have no idea.  I pretty much ignored buy ratings or price estimates by experts and looked at P/E ratios and their position compared to competitors in their field.  If a market leader was near their 52 week low then they were definitely on my radar.Market pullbacks happen all the time and that is when it's a great time to start buying.  I spent weeks and months waiting for the best time to buy some stocks and it was driving me nuts waiting.Prior to these purchases I had zero experience in the stock market.  So my advice to you is, go ahead and give it a shot and learn as you go.
My friend just started investing and we were coming up with ideas for a 5 stock portfolio.We came up with Nike, Disney, Visa, Starbucks, Apple.What do you think of these stocks for a starter portfolio? What would your 5 stock starter portfolio be?

**Banks**Earnings season kicked off in earnest on Tuesday with strong results from JP Morgan that were taken as a good omen for the economy in general and commercially focused banks in particular.  However, for me, the stand out bank reporting this week was **Pinnacle Financial Partners** which reported a 19% increase in Q3 EPS on Tuesday with double-digit loan and deposit growth, strong hiring throughout its businesses and substantial fee growth.Pinnacle is a small $4.5 billion Tennessee based commercial bank that has grown quickly using the strategy of recruiting top bankers from the larger regional banks and bringing in their teams and clients. That strategy has allowed Pinnacle to grow rapidly and profitably since bankers only bring over their best customers.  The company has doubled revenues over the past three years and strong Q3 growth shows the strategy is still working. The stock is up 3.5% since the report but, with a trailing PE of just 11.7, the market seems to be overlooking the growth and categorizing Pinnacle along with much less interesting bank stocks.&amp;#x200B;**Biopharmaceutical****Dermira** jumped 26% on Friday after the company published positive results from a mid-stage clinical trial for its new eczema treatment, lebrikizumab.  44% of patients treated with lebrikizumab exhibited 90% skin clearance. Thats similar to recently launched eczema treatment Dupixent. However, unlike Dupixent, lebrikizumab also proved to be effective at reducing chronic itching (pruritus) which is often a significant issue for eczema sufferers.  It also had less of an impact on the immune system.Dermira’s market cap was $390 million after Fridays rise.  However the stock could go a lot higher. There are nearly 7 million eczema sufferers in the US with currently untreatable conditions and the total addressable market for Dermira is estimated at $5 billion. Given its commercial advantages, regarding pruritus, Dermira should take a significant share of this if it can successfully transition from Phase 3 trials to FDA approval.&amp;#x200B;**Value Stocks****United Rentals** reported Q3 results on Wednesday with revenues up 17.6% and earnings up 17.4%.  Guidance was updated with revenues still expected to grow 6% for the year and the CEO said customers remain upbeat about their business prospects.  The market was not impressed, United Rentals after all has a large exposure to the construction industry and, as we near the end of the current up cycle, that is a concern.However United Rentals is much more than just a cyclical play. Growth is being driven by the benefits operators enjoy by renting machinery rather than owning machinery.  Renting allows customers to get the best and latest equipment, more flexibility, no storage costs and no debt. There is also still plenty of growth potential. United Rentals is the market leader but its market share is only 15%.  With crumbling US infrastructure and chronic housing shortages, it should expect to expand for many years to come. Current valuation with a trailing PE of 8.9 looks cheap.&amp;#x200B;**Large Caps (Netflix and Johnson &amp; Johnson)****Netflix** Q3 results on Wednesday were initially well received even though most of the 40% earnings surprise was accounted for by a once off non-cash item.  After adjusting for this, the core results still showed a very healthy 31% increase in revenues and 22.5% increase in earnings.However concerns about the imminent rise in (lower priced) competition from new streaming services to be provided by Disney+ and Apple TV+ hit home later on Thursday and Friday and the stock ended the week down 3.5%.  The focus has clearly switched to the reduced guidance for Q4 subscriber growth which now looks vulnerable and the valuation, at 88x trailing earnings and 7x trailing revenues, still looks very expensive.**Johnson &amp; Johnson** reported a Q3 beat and raise on Tuesday but any positivity unravelled on Friday when it was revealed that the company had recalled 33,000 bottles of baby powder after U.S. health regulators found trace amounts of asbestos. J&amp;J is working with the FDA to determine the integrity of the tested sample, and the validity of the test results, but it is nevertheless a set back for the company which has made repeated assurances regarding the products safety.Reputational issues aside, it could also prove very costly for the company. J&amp;J is fighting more than 14,000 lawsuits alleging its baby powder and talc products cause cancer. Last year, a St. Louis jury ruled that the company should pay $4.7 billion to 22 women who claimed the baby powder gave them ovarian cancer. The stock closed down 6.2% on Friday with a market capitalization of $337.0 billion.&amp;#x200B;**Acquisition**Unnamed sources at Bloomberg reported that Apollo Global Management had made a $40 offer for **Hilton Grand Vacations**, the timeshare resort operator, and that the Blackstone Group had also made an offer.  A bidding war could prove very profitable for investors, and the stock did jump about 5%, but at $34.34 it still remains well below the price quoted by “unnamed” sources. At that price, either the stock is offering us a great opportunity to buy or alternatively the story is a load of garbage.  I wish I knew which was true.&amp;#x200B;Please feel free to “FOLLOW” me if you would like to see my regular updates during the week.This is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are risky and not suitable for everybody. Please do your own research. Please note that a number of the above stocks are speculative high risk companies.

Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 6th, 2020.# **Geopolitical tensions could hold back stocks in the week ahead, as investors await jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/geopolitical-tensions-could-hold-back-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)*******&gt; Geopolitical concerns could continue to weigh on stocks in the week ahead, leaving investors wondering whether Middle East tensions will be the catalyst for a much anticipated market pullback.*****&gt; Stocks sold off Friday, the second trading day of the year, after a rally to new highs on Thursday. The market was slammed after the U.S. killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, sparking a rally in oil prices and raising concerns Iran will take some retaliatory action.*****&gt; The big event in the coming week is the December employment report, expected to show 160,000 payrolls were added and average earnings rose 3.1% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. The jobs report is especially important after December’s ISM manufacturing data Friday was surprisingly negative and the weakest in more than a decade.*****&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the four-day week at 3,235, with a loss of 0.2%, after Friday’s 0.7% decline. Treasury yields retreated on Friday, as buyers moved into the safety of bonds and the 10-year yield was at 1.78%.*****&gt; “This was a textbook rationale for a bout of profit taking, but that said, I don’t think it’s dramatic,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Nonetheless, the question will be when do buyers come in ... Much will depend on this weekend and next week in terms of headlines from both the White House and Iran.”*****&gt; Some analysts have been looking for a minor selloff in stocks after the fourth quarter’s 8.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500. But whether Friday’s decline is the start of something bigger is unclear.*****&gt; “It could be, but only in retrospect will you know for sure,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.*****&gt; Boockvar said if Iran takes some minor action, the market could shrug it off, oil could lose its gains, and stocks could move higher again.*****&gt; “We may see Treasurys continue to get a big bid, gold get a bid and the safe-haven currencies get a bid. If we go into things next week and all things are quiet, the market will pay attention to the data,” Krosby said.*****&gt; Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities, expects to see Treasury yields lower initially. “I think short-term, the geopolitical risk is probably going to override any fundamental views that people have of the marketplace,” he said.*****&gt; But there could be a catalyst for some Treasury selling with the issuance of high level of corporate bonds in the coming week. Faranello expects the year to start off strong, with corporate treasurers looking to raise about $30 billion to $35 billion in the debt market.*****&gt; Strategists said they will be looking closely at the jobs data after Friday’s surprisingly weak manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management, which was expected to have been better because of the trade agreement.*****&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the survey actually took place before the trade deal was announced, and he’s waiting for the results of the next couple of reports.*****&gt; He expects to see 165,000 jobs added in December, off of 266,000 in November, which was in part skewed by the end of GM’s strike. “I think there’s a little upside risk. It seems like we saw a pretty strong Christmas season,” he said, adding there could have been more hiring than was factored into seasonal adjustments.*****# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/aoDnUW7.png))**# **Major Indices for this past week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6x4NtiW.png))**# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/I3ZNEuH.png))**# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QqYTbUD.png))**# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3Ltxt2.png))**# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CyHtJoF.png))**# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RO92K5i.png)**# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SEszd5M.png))**# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Trp0mo0.png))**# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/V19lVTd.png))**# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tlPjW9c.png))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aicevVU.png))*******# Typical January Trading: Volatile Last 20 Years&gt; Yesterday major indexes continued their recent trend of strength on the first trading day of 2020. While today the market has turned weaker on escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. This type of volatility was once quite rare in January. However since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined ten times in twenty years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the eighth trading day. Greatest weakness has appeared just after mid-month, the eleventh trading day. Mild average losses on or around the eleventh trading day quickly swell to over 2% for DJIA and nearly as much for S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82a79e9eb21df6d414fd0ec1c7725b4d/e48bbc4e7f5b7041-e9/s500x750/6a964dc4a15e1c9ab0fcc9ccc451f6e642aacff5.jpg))*******# A Banner Year for US Equities&gt; 2019 was surely a banner year for US equities. With a total return of 31.5%, the S&amp;P 500's gain in 2019 was nearly three times the historical average 12-month return of 11.7%. That's strong! In the chart below we compare the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to its average annualized returns over those same time frames since 1928. While the one-year return sticks out like a sore thumb, we would note that the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last two, three, and ten years are also above average. Almost as notable as the fact that the one year return has been so much stronger than average is that the S&amp;P 500's two-year return is less than two percentage points above its historical average. That just shows how bad 2018 was! Looking further out, the only time frame where returns are below average is over the last twenty years where the 6.1% annualized gain is almost five percentage points below the historical average. Over a full twenty years, that's a difference of tripling your investment versus making eight times your investment!&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns.png))**&gt; The chart below compares how current returns during the above time frames rank on a percentile basis relative to all other periods. The S&amp;P 500's one-year return ranks in the 85th percentile which is pretty extreme. For the two, five, and ten year periods, though, current returns are much more middle of the road. Conversely, as stretched as extreme to the upside that the one-year return is relative to all other periods, the twenty-year return is even more depressed to the downside. At just 4.6, more than 95% of all other 20-year periods have been better than the last 20.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile.png))**&gt; Finally, as mentioned above the last year has certainly been a strong one, and it follows a year where returns had been abnormally poor. The chart below shows the rolling 12-month total return for the S&amp;P 500 going back to 1990. The gain of 31.49% over the last year was the strongest for the S&amp;P 500 in six years coming up just shy of the 32.39% gain in 2013. Last year at this time, though, the S&amp;P 500 was down over 4% on a total return basis in the prior 12 months.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns-Percentile-rolling.png))*******# 2019 and 2020 Dogs of the Dow&gt; The Dogs of the Dow strategy is a simple, hands-off investment approach that says to buy the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow 30 at the start of each year. With the calendar turning over from 2019 to 2020, below is a look at how the Dogs strategy performed in 2019. As shown, the 10 Dogs posted a total return of 19.38% in 2019, which was below the 25% return for the Dow and well below the 28% that the 20 non-Dogs returned. The biggest winner in the Dogs in 2019 was JP Morgan (JPM) with a gain of 47.27%, but Pfizer's (PFE) decline of 6.92% really hurt overall performance.&gt; The 20 non-Dogs were led by Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), and United Tech (UTX), while Walgreens Boots (WBA) and 3M (MMM) were the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019.

Eight of the ten Dogs from 2019 remain on the list, while 3M (MMM) and Walgreens Boots (WBA) -- the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019 -- have replaced JP Morgan (JPM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) -- the two biggest gainers of the Dogs in 2019. Dow Inc. (DOW) is the highest yielding Dog at 5.12%, followed by Exxon (XOM), IBM, and Verizon (VZ), which all have dividend yields above 4%.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/2020dogs.png))*******# Full Year 2019, Q4, and December Asset Class Total Returns&gt; Below are the final total return performance numbers for key ETFs across asset classes in 2019. For each ETF, we also include its performance in Q4 and December.&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.9% in December and 8.99% in Q4 to finish the full year up 31.22%. The Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) was by far the best performing US index ETF in 2019 with a gain of 38.96%, and it was the third best ETF in the entire matrix. The title of best performing ETF in 2019 goes to the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector ETF (XLK), which rallied 49.86%. Remember, 40% of XLK is made up of just Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which gained 89% and 58% in 2019, respectively. The Russia stock market ETF (RSX) was the second biggest winner in the matrix with a 2019 total return of 40.79%.&gt; Everywhere you look across the equity landscape, there were big winners in 2019, but the weakest area of the market was the Energy sector ETF (XLE). Even still, XLE managed to put up double-digit percentage gains on the year at +11.74%.&gt; In the commodities space, we saw oil gain 32.61% in 2019, which actually bested the gain for the S&amp;P 500. Gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) both put in solid gains in the mid-teens, while the perpetually losing natural gas ETF (UNG) was the only ticker in the matrix that fell across all three time frames (December, Q4, and full year).&gt; Looking at fixed income, the aggregate bond market ETFs (AGG and BND) posted total returns of 8%+, while the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) gained 14% on the year. Q4 and December were tough for fixed income, however, as rates moved higher.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/assetclass1231.png))*******# January Almanac: Average Performance Slips in Presidential Election Years&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations typically propels stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and sixth for DJIA since 1950. It is the end of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. Last year, January was downright stellar after the worst December since 1931 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.&gt; In election years, Januarys have been weaker. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 slip to number #8 while DJIA average performance dips negative.

Analysts expect growth of +0.4%, in line with December’s durable goods orders growth of +0.4%. * The United States will also announce **factory orders growth in January** at 10:00 AM today. Analysts expect growth of +0.1% while December saw higher factor orders growth of +0.3%.   * Oppenheimer technical analysis strategists argue that **the current rally in low volatility stocks is positive for the US stock market in general**.  While the S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility index is up +17% since the S&amp;P500 hit its lows on December 24th, it has underperformed the broader S&amp;P 500.  The divergence in performance suggests that while low volatility stocks have performed well, it is simply a function of broader re-rating of the S&amp;P 500. * A **weaker US Dollar will be needed to help boost the S&amp;P 500 further** according to Bloomberg.  Unless the Greenback weakens in the second half of CY2019, we may not see a strong recovery in tech and materials stocks earnings – the two sectors who saw the largest EPS declines in 1H.  * After another “no vote” on her BREXIT Plan in the UK Parliament, **UK Prime Minister Theresa May is looking for another extension to the deadline** for the UK exit of the European Union (EU). * The VIX is little changed this morning and is currently at 13.1 after closing at 13.1 yesterday* **iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI)** April 18 OTM Calls and **Coty (COTY)** May 2019 OTM Calls &amp; Puts are the most actively traded options contracts in US pre-market trading this morning. * US 10-Year Treasury Bonds are higher with yields down -0.36 basis points to 2.5997%* The US Treasury 2s-10s Spread has widened 0.06 basis points to 0.15%* WTI Crude is currently up 0.97% to USD$59.09/bbl with the Brent-WTI spread little changed USD$0.05 to USD$8.5/bbl* Gold is currently up 0.36% to USD$1308.36/oz* Current global crude **oil prices will need a further rally in the US stock market and sustained production cuts from OPEC** according to analysis by Bloomberg.  While Saudi Arabia has recently cut production targets, The Kingdom continues to produce 1mm bbls/day above CY2014 production levels.  This would suggest the current production cuts only address last year’s excess capacity and do not properly confront the impact of decelerating global growth on oil demand.  ### Stocks Trending in the News* **Antofagasta (LSE:ANTO)** declared another large dividend in the wake of record production.  Antofagasta declared a 37 cents per share dividend which brings the total annual dividend to 43.5 cents per share.  That represents a 60.5% payout, well above the minimum 35% payout that is the company’s policy.  Record production and a tight copper markets are benefitting Antofagasta.  Antofagasta is rated :Top Short” in our United Kingdom Global Top Stock Ideas.* **Apple (AAPL)** debuted a new mid-tier model of its iPad and an update to the iPad mini.  The new iPad model is called the iPad Air and features and 10.5-inch screen; this model was phased out a few years ago when the iPad Pro was introduced.  The iPad min saw the first update since 2015.  The announcements come a week before Apple is expected to introduce a media and entertainment bundle with TV and streaming, including Apple produced content.  Apple is rated “Neutral” in our US Large-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas and “Neutral” in our US Information Technology Global Top Stock Ideas.* **China Telecom (SEHK:728)** reported full year net income that beat consensus.  Full year net income of 21.2 billion yuan beat the 20.44 billion yuan consensus.  China Telecom full year dividend per share is 12.5 Hong Kong cents per share.  China Telecom said 80% of its customer are using 4G at the end of the quarter.  China Telecom’s is focused on 5G rollout.  China Telecom is rated “Top Buy” in our China All-Cap Global Top Stock Ideas.* **Coty (COTY)** could be completely acquired by **JAB Holdings Ltd.

Initially posted this on [bb_stock ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lsxrq9/stop_whining/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and was hoping to get some sort of intelligent feedback but should have not made that assumption. Figured I’d come here and see if I can solicit some better ideas. I’m new to r/stocks so if I’ve screwed up on some of your rules please let me know.I generally invest in high growth data stocks as I work in the industry and I’m beginning to think blackberry will be nicely positioned in a couple of years to dominate and worst case the rising tide will raise all the boats.Smarter people can break down the financials so I want to focus on positioning, markets, branding, board members and the AWS partnership. I’m doing my best to clean up my last post because I realize this is a higher level of discourse.1. Repeat CEO: you’re not paying for someone to learn on the job, John Chen has done it before and can handle the stress. I’m thinking this is his swan song.He has a 90 million dollar bonus at a $30 USD price point for 10 days by 2023. don’t think CEOs generally miss out on 90 million dollar bonuses but hey what do I know.2. Potential market size: IOT security and data collection. I personally care the most about their auto investment in QNX and IVY but the board of directors reflect a whole slew of other bets that are also potentially majorly profitable.The military side of the equation may become more material with the New board member: Lisa Disbrow.Once again I’ll defer to smarter people to do market evaluation and sizing.3. Sales orientation/cycle: this is a company that usually deals with governments, financial institutions, and enterprise clients. They are used to the longer and more complex sales cycles associated with this so there will be no learning curve when approaching larger clients.4. [Board of directors:](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/board-of-directors) I like to follow money and influence.Interesting highlights:John Chen’s: CEO that delivered an exit of Sybase. Really strong history of maintaining relationships in China and on trade boards with China. See BOD link above.Prem Watsa: Canada’s Warren Buffett. Reddit deity of justifying this investment. Fairfax financial and a value investor. He brought in John ChenMike Daniels: John Chen’s Sybase buddy and cybersecurity executive. Well positioned to influence across the cyber security industryTimothy Dattels: TPG Capital major investor in Asia.Lisa Disbrow: New Board member. She is the military connection and was Senate-confirmed Under Secretary of the United States Air Force, and she served as Acting Secretary of the U.S. Air Force from January 2017 to May 2017.Richard Lynch : Ex-cto of Verizon wireless.Dr. Smaldone Alsup: Pharma positioning, take a look at [PharmApprove](https://pharmapprove.com) and you’ll get a better sense of her speciality working on positioning.Barbara Stymiest: Big player in Canada. Current portfolio includes: director of George Weston Limited, Sun Life Financial Inc. and the University Health Network, and is Chair of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. For you Americans out there George Weston is the really big name there.Wayne Wouters: Strategy and policy advisor on the government front. at one point he was Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister of Canada.Just wanted to give a high level breakdown of the board and if you can give a more complete picture on benefits and risks of these players I’d love to hear it.5. BLACKBERRY IVY:  Generally I don’t look that deeply into products but I’ll do you all a favour and break down the branding and real market value to both companies.It’s an Amazon partnership but it’s called Blackberry Ivy. Does that strike you as being a bit interesting? They avoided the Amazon brand name on purpose. BB owns the commercial relationship limiting Amazon’s exposure to the customer and fear of being screwed by the 2nd largest company in the world.Auto execs are all aware of competition risks coming from Apple and Google. Also on the Google front they have learned from advertising that Google like to own the data. Tesla is a direct competitor so I don’t see much risk losing OEM business to then.It’s been branded blackberry and avoided touching anything associated with data ownership to make the product more attractive to the OEMs.They are looking for a monopoly on the censors and data transfer and have what seems like a 2 year head start.This is a rounding error for Amazon but material for bb. Amazon payoff will be the number of clients that transfer to AWS because of ease of integration and reduced costs of moving the data.6. Blackberry and Apple: every single employee of blackberry knows what happened with Apple and knows what happens when you sit comfortably on a lead as opposed to paying offence. If you are worried about a company culture that is stagnant and moving too slowly go find someone who is currently winning not a comeback kid.7. Negatives:Shit brand with reputation as an loser.ARR: the only thing that really matters. Of course Ivy is a subscription that wasn’t a surprise. They need to show positive growth and then you can be considered a 10-20x revenue cap. Do that for 4 quarters and then you can be a cool kid and get to 50x.TL;DR. I want actual feedback so if you don’t just post rockets or some other bullshit that would be great
Hello,As the title said, I can invest from 250$ to 350$ each month. I'm \~31 yo and I already invested in a home purchase savings scheme. Here is where I already invested:ETFs:*  $SPY : 100$*  $VTI 300$Stocks:* Paypal: 100$* Baba: 150$* Apple 75$* Microsoft: 200$* Douyu 150$* Xiaomi: 100$* Unity: 50$Do you have any recommendation regarding investing? Should I add more into ETFs? Did I miss some basic interesting stocks? Should I diversify my investing and how?Thank you for your attention.
If you haven't heard of streaming music by now, you must be friends with Patrick Star. I feel that the company will provide strong financials, but moving forward, what is their growth strategy? There are already big players in the market with Apple and I don't see how the platform evolves past it's current form. Apple also is key reason for downloads with their AppStore. It's not like this company going public will provide easier access to customers. Please give me your thoughts.EDIT: Nothing like getting downvoted without an explanation.EDIT 2: Maybe they will make a store for music. That could be something, but kind of against the model.
Last month, I made %50 profit by QCOM-apple agreement by following tech news, therefore I miss the oppurtunity to buy appl cheap. I have no idea about other industries. is there any useful accurate website for such occasions. or should I watch just mainstread media and some ordinary economy blogs?&amp;#x200B;Note : I'm not talking about ''10 stocks to buy in 2019'' or ''123 stocks to boom in 2035'' kind of shit.&amp;#x200B;thank you all.
This in addition to a half year performance of -47,44% in stockprice and a PE of 42,05 and forward PE of 29,13 and a 52-week high over 200 while it being at $100 ATM. I think this stock might turn bullish once again. Your thoughts on oled in the near future (3 to 6 months)?

Hey what's up r/stocks! Good morning and happy Sunday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead this week.Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 29th, 2019.# **Investors brace for a roller-coaster week ahead with Fed decision and Apple, Alphabet earnings - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/investors-brace-for-a-roller-coaster-week-ahead-with-fed-decision-and-apple-alphabet-earnings.html)*******&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize the Fed will continue to be patient and hold back from raising interest rates, but there is a risk the Fed could inject some volatility into markets in the week ahead.*****&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, in a week heavy with earnings news and some key economic reports. Friday’s employment report tops the list of data releases, but there is also PCE inflation Monday and monthly vehicle sales Wednesday. There are more than 150 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, including Apple, Alphabet and drug majors Merck and Pfizer.*****&gt; “I don’t think the Fed is going to signal any big change in its policy stance next week. If anything, they will talk about how the economy is showing signs of improvement and therefore, it is appropriate to remain patient and see how things evolve,” said Mark Cabana, head of short U.S. rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.*****&gt; Fed officials are sure to discuss Friday’s surprisingly strong report of 3.2% economic growth in the first quarter, much better than the 2.5% pace expected by economists. It is also far better than the flattish growth forecasts and recession fears that cropped up during the first quarter when data looked spotty and the government was closed for five weeks.*****&gt; “I’m sure it’s going to heat up the internal debate on what the direction of policy should be,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. Economists expect the Fed to retain its dovish tone even with the better U.S. data because uncertainty remains about global growth, particularly from Europe.*****&gt; But some stock traders have been concerned with stocks near record highs, that the Fed may not want to sound quite as dovish, as it did after its January and March meetings when it ‘pivoted’ its policy to remove rate hikes from the forecast this year.*****&gt; “There’s some scope for disappointment there,” said Cabana.*****&gt; But then the Fed, and markets, have focused on the lack of inflation and the fact that will keep the Fed in an easier policy stance. Some market pros are counting on interest rate cuts, before the Fed ever hikes rates again.*****&gt; The Fed has targeted a 2% inflation rate. Core PCE inflation for the first quarter fell to a 1.7% pace, year over year, from 1.9% in the fourth quarter. March inflation data is released on Monday.*****&gt; “Our view has been and continues to be that the constant undershooting of core PCE that was again confirmed today is something that has the Fed perplexed, which is central to our theses that the Fed is going to cut rates later this year,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG. He expects the Fed to cut interest rates in both September and December.*****&gt; Emanuel also pointed out that first quarter GDP contained some transitory factors like a positive impact from trade and inventories that are not recurring, and inventories could even detract from second quarter growth. But some economists expect consumers to become a stronger force in the second quarter and make up for some of that.*****&gt; Emanuel said he expects the S&amp;P 500, which surpassed its previous closing high of 2,930, in the past week, to reach a high of 3,000 this year. The S&amp;P is up more than 3% in April so far, and earnings season has been mostly positive for stocks.*****&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.2% in the past week, closing Friday at 2,939, just under its all-time intra-day high of 2,940, from Sept. 21. The Nasdaq was up 1.9% for the week at a new closing high of 8,146. But the Dow was down 0.1% for the week, ending at 26,543, still 1.5% below its intra-day high.*****&gt; Big earnings week&gt; The first quarter earnings season was expected to be the first negative quarter for profit growth in three years, but as of Friday, earnings growth looks to be flattish, based on actual numbers for companies that have already reported and estimates for others, according to Refinitiv.*****&gt; According to Emanuel, the coming week’s earnings will be important, and now there are reports from big pharma. He said health care has become more attractive to him as it has come under pressure this year.*****&gt; “If you look at the rebound, that is only four months old, the easy money has been made and the easy money has been made in technology,” he said. “From our point of view, we like the places investors have had a more difficult time.” He said two of those sectors are health care and financials.*****&gt; “With regard to technology there has been an element of performance chase that has crept into the market,” he said.*****&gt; Technology, since the start of the year, has been the best performing of the major S&amp;P sectors, with a gain of 26%. Financials are up 18.4%, and health care is the worst performing sector, up just 2.5%*****&gt; “If you think about part of the reason the health care sector has been under such intense pressure recently, it is the expectation that legislatively, not only are prices rising less, but you could also have an element of deflation in that sector. Our view point is that is not likely to materialize,” Emanuel said. “We see the weakness in healthcare as much more a function of the majority of the universe is frightened by Medicare for all, and those that aren’t are frightened by the prospect of the Affordable Care Act being repealed. We don’t see either of those happening.”*****&gt; Emanuel said he’s currently being selective in buying stocks, especially given risks to the market like unresolved trade talks between the U.S. and China; the slowdown in Chinese stimulus and weaker growth, particularly in Europe.*****# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://finviz.com/publish/042619/sec_all_w1_173277427.png))**# **Major Indices for this past week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/j5dKhpy.png))**# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/kpzJXo4.png))**# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/M4U0TnP.png))**# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6Bzj4Ot.png))**# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oFQ2z44.png))**# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nKZUpu2.png))**# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/geMAbkt.png))**# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KXEgJy4.png))**# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0ahuAUT.png))**# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EMNd0Tg.png))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rw9AlkZ.png))*******# Typical May Trading: Just a Couple of Positive Areas&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear “Sell in May.” But when exactly in May is the “best” time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May’s eighteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/40af3b2f1d51b103a95449afb064de43/tumblr_inline_pqkyisFWm11spdppr_500.jpg))*******# Its Official – Happy 10th Birthday Bull Market&gt; Yesterday’s new all-time closing high by S&amp;P 500 finally made it official. The current bull market is now in its eleventh year and is the second longest since 1949 and second best by performance with a 333.6% gain from its March 9, 2009 low through its closing high. Since 1949, the longest bull market lived over twelves years from December 1987 to March 2000 and gained 582.1%. Thus far the current bull has endured five corrections ranging from 10.2% to 19.8%. Tame inflation, a dovish Fed and the prospects for continued earnings growth suggest this bull is likely to continue.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e3dc0a0ebbdbfa17233cc896b723138/tumblr_inline_pqhfsax1Mt1spdppr_540.jpg))*******# End of the Best Six Months. Should You Sell in May?&gt; It’s hard for us not to be associated with “Sell in May” and we welcome the opportunity it provides to discuss seasonality and share our analysis and our evidence-based, time-tested and historically-proven “Best Six Months Switching Strategy.” First of all we do not simply Sell in May and go away. And we don’t sell anything until we get a technical confirmation from our MACD Seasonal Sell Signal. When we do get that MACD Sell Signal we will sell some positions in our Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy Portfolio and pick up some bond positions as well as other portfolio maneuvers.&gt; Because of the elevated level of risk that has been historically observed during the “Worst Six Months” of the year and its historically tepid returns, reducing long exposure and developing a defensive strategy is the approach we take in the Almanac InvestorStock and ETF Portfolios. We do not merely “sell in May and go away.” Instead we take some profits, trim or outright sell underperforming stock and ETF positions, tighten stop losses and limit adding new long exposure to positions from sectors that have a demonstrated record of outperforming during the period.&gt; For those with a lower risk tolerance or a desire to take a break from trading, the “Worst Months” are a great opportunity to unwind longs and move into the relative safety of cash, Treasury bonds, gold and/or some combination of. Preservation of capital may be more important than growth and with historical averages and frequency of gains reduced; the “Worst Six Months” are a good time to simply step aside if you prefer. August, September and/or October have provided some excellent buying opportunities in recent years and could do the same again this year.&gt; Sure the market got slammed in the first two months (November-December) of the Best Six Months in 2018, nothing’s perfect. It happens. We stuck it out, did not panic at the December 24 low and road the recovery rally. The history of the Best Six/Worst Six Months is undeniable and it still works. There have been off periods throughout its history. The full history is on our website and in the Almanac. But here are a couple of graphs to illustrate.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/04e0f9f1866a883f9ba6e8c50c1d431f/tumblr_inline_pqfr3qzBYG1spdppr_500.jpg))**&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5151fc06a4bf2c2cf5886554699f07da/tumblr_inline_pqfr404UNI1spdppr_500.jpg))*******# Next Bump in Pre-Election Year Rally Could Arise in May&gt; As of today’s close, DJIA is up 13.6% year-to-date as of today’s close. S&amp;P 500 is up 16.0% and NASDAQ is at 20.8%. Compared to average pre-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past pre-election year average performance for this point of the year. Aside from a brief excursion on the second trading day of the year, 2019 has largely tracked pre-election year historical performance and then some. Should this trend continue, then the next area of concern is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates. However, should late May weakness materialize, it could prove to be a fair entry point as the market usually rallies through June to mid-July.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3d0279bc7d760cf66137ca9c1882aec/tumblr_inline_pqdpq8LsIl1spdppr_500.jpg))**&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/32fbcbfa3756480792d253680817298d/tumblr_inline_pqdpqrnKh21spdppr_500.jpg))**&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3687b7c287aa27b0252e510eed0456f/tumblr_inline_pqdpqyLleT1spdppr_500.jpg))*******# B.I.G. Tips - Early Earnings Season Analysis&gt; More than 500 stocks have reported their first quarter numbers so far this earnings season, which gives us a pretty large sample size to start analyzing overall trends. Through today, 67% of stocks that have reported this season have beaten bottom-line consensus EPS estimates. That's a strong reading relative to the historical average of roughly 60% going back to 1999 (first chart below).&gt; While the bottom line beat rate is strong, the top line has so far been lacking. As shown in the second chart below, only 53.6% of companies have managed to report stronger than expected revenues this season. This is definitely a concern now that we're already about a quarter of the way through the reporting period. We would note, though, that last season we saw a similar trend as the top-line beat rate started very low before rebounding by the end of the reporting period and actually showing a sequential increase.&gt; On another note, we've seen an interesting shift in guidance compared to the last two quarters. We're also seeing some negative signs when it comes to how stock prices are reacting to earnings reports.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/beatrates0426.png))************# 10 Observations on New Highs&gt; We wrote about the new record high for the S&amp;P 500 Index Wednesday . This is such a big market event we wanted to share some additional thoughts—10 of them in fact—on this market milestone:&gt; The new high secured March 9, 2019, as the 10th anniversary of the bull market. If the S&amp;P 500 hadn’t made a new high before the next bear market, this bull would have ended short of the 10-year mark.&gt; Don’t fear new highs. Historically, buying stocks at all-time highs has been productive over the long term, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. Going back to 1950, the average 12-month gain from a new high for the S&amp;P 500 has been 9.8%, excluding dividends.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dont-fear-record-highs.png?ssl=1))**&gt; When new highs have been more than six months apart, as the last two were, average gains in the S&amp;P 500 historically have been about 12% in the 12 months after the new record.&gt; For those worried that a new high means sub-par long-term returns, consider that the average 5-year annualized gain in the S&amp;P 500 from all-time highs is 9%. For 10 years, it’s a still solid 7.4% (excluding dividends).&gt; History has shown stocks’ strong start to the year could mean further gains down the road. The average rest-of-year gain for the S&amp;P 500 after a double-digit first quarter rally has been 6%.&gt; Global growth is supportive. Owning stocks when economic conditions are improving, as they are in the United States and China in particular, tends to be rewarding.&gt; We don’t think stocks are overvalued. The S&amp;P 500 price-to-earnings ratio (PE) based on consensus analysts’ estimates for the next 12 months is 16.7, very reasonable considering low interest rates and inflation.&gt; Not all the possible good news is priced in. Investors may get more than they expect out of the U.S.-China trade deal, which could boost business confidence and capital investment.Earnings may be a positive catalyst. First-quarter earnings season is off to a good start overall, and we think 2019 expectations are too low.&gt; Sentiment is not overly bullish. Just 33.5% of individual investors are bullish, according to the American Association of Individual Investors. Other sentiment measures we follow are far from euphoric.&gt; Looking ahead, we believe there are enough potential positive catalysts to propel the S&amp;P 500 to our year-end fair value target of 3,000 this year. At the same time, we acknowledge the risks, particularly overseas—Europe faces structural challenges, lackluster growth, and upcoming Brexit hurdles. The possibility of a pickup in volatility against a favorable fundamental backdrop supports our recommended market weight equities allocation.*****# The Waiting Game for Record Highs&gt; The wait is over.&gt; After more than seven months, the S&amp;P 500 Index notched a fresh all-time closing high of 2,933.68 on April 23. To get here, investors have weathered back-and-forth in trade negotiations, a historic government shutdown, unrelenting Brexit headlines, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) U-turn in policy, and signs of a global slowdown.&gt; Fortunately, U.S. stocks have powered through record highs after a prolonged dry spell. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has climbed an average of 12.9% in the 12 months after snapping at least 6-month long record high drought, based on data since 1950.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Climbing-the-wall-of-worry-1.png?ssl=1))**&gt; “It has been a long time since the S&amp;P 500 scored a new high, yet this could actually hint at future gains,” said LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The waiting game for record highs may be tough, but it has proven the durability of this bull market based on sound fundamentals.”&gt; Stocks’ rapid rebound this year has been impressive, especially 10 years into the current bull market. The S&amp;P 500 has rallied more than 20% from the December lows amid the Fed’s pause in rate hikes, progress in trade talks, and an uptick in economic data after a soft beginning to 2019.&gt; Historically, when U.S. stocks have gone six months without a record, investors have had to contend with a significantly longer waiting period (and more market volatility). The benchmark has taken an average of 25 months to post new highs in times it hasn’t hit a record within six months.&gt; We’ve maintained that the late-2018 sell-off was overdone, and we see a compelling case for equities near these levels based on sound economic fundamentals. However, the recovery has been arguably a bit fast considering some of the reasons for the decline have yet to be resolved. We think the S&amp;P 500 could eventually move higher and make a run at our 3,000 fair value target, but we wouldn’t be surprised to see volatility pick up over the next few months.*****# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for April 26th, 2019**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 04.28.19**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)*****Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-*****&gt;

The NFL is massive. Huge. Last year the NFL had $14 billion in sales.The iPad, which has been viewed as an ugly step child by Wall Street brought in $23 billion last year. Crazy.  The iPad alone is over 60% bigger than the entire NFL.   Yet Wall Street views the iPad as a footnote in the overall financial performance of Apple. Crazy.Hell even Miscellaneous revenue is almost as big as the NFL.  Miscellaneous revenue is AppleTV, Beats, Airpod, AppleWatch, and accessories.  That alone was $11 BILLION in sales.Miscellaneous revenue was bigger than Major League Baseball and the NBA last year. Wow.
Every time someone new posts about wanting to invest or asking if this is a good time to invest, one phrase always comes up and it's fucking pissing me off.*Oh yeah, go ahead, see if you can time the market big shot.*Nobody is fucking trying to time the market. That is literally impossible. Even people who have been investing for decades can't time the market. Nobody can predict the future. Some bubble could burst and the market could fall off a fucking cliff tomorrow.My point is, stop fucking badgering all the new guys who are trying to learn and deterring them from giving this is a try. All they really mean to say is that they believe this is a good time to buy because stocks are dropping so they are cheap. **When's the next time you'll be able to buy Apple or Disney for below $100?** That might not happen for a long time. Yeah if they buy tomorrow, the market could drop for the rest of the week, Disney could fall down into the high 80s and they might have a small loss for a bit. But it will eventually fucking climb back up. It's fucking Disney. Not some penny stock. Thinking long term, this is a good time to buy. Stocks like Disney will climb. I'm buying. Fuck you and your discouragement.

Tim cool its sure a savage business man:Intend behind lawsuit surely backfired. Apple now pay $9 and not $7.5 pr. phone.“Goal: Reduce Apple’s net royalty to Qualcomm.” Apple said in the document it planned to accomplish this in several ways, including “Hurt Qualcomm financially” and “Put Qualcomm’s licensing model at risk.”What was revealed on the article will help Qualcomm cases vs. FTC and others.https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/19/apple-said-qualcomms-tech-was-no-good-private-communications-it-was-best/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.99038020f45d
I'm on the ground floor for Sports and sports fans. And let me tell you that ESPN is doomed. There really is no reason for younger demographic (under 40) even to turn to ESPN.Most younger fans won't pay $$ to watch sports on TV. They rather just watch short clips and highlights on Twitter or stream them on various streaming sites (even Youtube).As far as talk shows, there are dozens of independent Sports talk shows on Youtube. Even Reddit is destroying ESPN. If I want the most updated news on the NBA I just go to rNBA. 100% faster than waiting through 20 minutes of commercials on ESPN.Bottom line is ESPN cutting talent is the exact opposite thing they need to do. Ratings will continue to tumble and paid subs will bleed them dry.Bottom line is Disney/ESPN is tied to these horrible contracts with the NFL/NBA/MLB that cost $6 billion a year for the next decade. ESPN will lose Disney billions each year.Disney needs to sell ESPN ASAP before ratings/subs drop even more. Sell it to Apple, Google, or Amazon. Those companies have hundreds of billions in cash. They don't mind losing a couple billion a year to expand their ecosystem.

Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 14th, 2019.# **Profits expected to fall as earnings season kicks off in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/11/profits-expected-to-fall-as-earnings-season-kicks-off-in-the-week-ahead.html)*******&gt; The third-quarter earnings season kicks off in the coming week, and it is likely to expose how much the trade war has cost companies’ bottom lines.*****&gt; First out of the gate are major banks and financial companies, with J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs reporting Tuesday. But by the end of the week, a smattering of industrial, tech, transportation and consumer names will have reported, including Alcoa and Honeywell. Netflix and IBM report Wednesday, and consumer giant Coca-Cola reports Friday. United Airlines reports Tuesday, and CSX reports Wednesday.*****&gt; Besides earnings, some important economic reports are being released, including retail sales on Wednesday and industrial production Thursday.*****&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are expected to decline by 3.1% for the third quarter, after growing by more than 3% in the second quarter, according to data from Refinitiv. For the second quarter, earnings were also expected to be negative to flat, but results beat lowered expectations.*****&gt; “The story of are we going to be negative, or are we not going to be negative, is going to be in focus,” said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse.*****&gt; Palfrey said margins are being pinched in several areas, including energy, with the decline in oil prices. Oil has been responding more to worries about global growth and trade wars than to geopolitical developments that normally could drive it higher. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 7.5% in the third quarter.*****&gt; “We are of the view that companies will likely devote a significant portion of their time talking about the impact of trade tariffs,” Palfrey said. “The goal is to ascertain just how much the decline in earnings is coming from those pressures.”*****&gt; The decline in oil prices, in fact, are expected to drag down profits in the energy sector. Earnings for the energy sector are expected to be down 32%, while revenues are expected to fall by 9.5%, according to Credit Suisse. Margins for the sector are expected to contract by 22.7%. Without energy estimates included, S&amp;P profits would be down just 1%, according to Refinitiv.*****&gt; “We think margins are going to subtract 5.9% from EPS growth of the S&amp;P 500,” said Palfrey. He projects earnings overall to decline by 4.2%, and he does not expect the stock market to make much headway during the earnings season.*****&gt; “I think we’re moving sideways. The real backstop is the environment, while under pressure, it is nonrecessionary, and that will ultimately prevent the market from materially selling off,” said Palfrey.*****&gt; Palflrey said a group he calls “tech plus,” which include tech and communications companies, have taken some of the biggest margin hits this quarter even though revenue growth remains solid. Six of the top 10 companies whose margins impacted S&amp;P earnings growth the most are from that group, including Alphabet , Amazon, Apple, Facebook, IBM and Micron.*****&gt; As a group, their margins are expected to contract by 14.8%, compared with 3.6% for all other S&amp;P 500 companies combined.*****&gt; ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum are on the list of companies with the biggest margin hits. Exxon for example saw a decline in margins of 34%, and Credit Suisse estimates that pared 0.6% off overall S&amp;P 500 earnings growth. Credit Suisse says the consensus decline in Amazon margins is expected to be 42.5%, denting S&amp;P earnings growth by 0.3%.*****&gt; “At least for earnings, it’s a relatively positive backdrop. We should see a little bit of clarity on the whole China trade,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. Hickey said in the past two quarters, stocks did well at the start of the reporting season, but they were then derailed by trade developments in the latter part of the earnings period.*****&gt; Palfrey said the market is being held back by several factors, including the slowdown in the manufacturing sector. “I think it’s going to be difficult for the market to move meaningfully higher without an improvement in industrial data and without the yield curve becoming uninverted,” he said.*****&gt; ISM manufacturing data has been weakening and has shown a contraction in activity for the past two months.*****&gt; The inverted yield curve is a bond market recession warning. When the curve is inverted, shorter duration securities yield more than longer duration securities, meaning investors are demanding a higher yield to hold investments for a much briefer time. In this case, the 3-month Treasury bill was yielding about 11 more basis points than the 10-year note.*****&gt; Hickey said there could be some positives in the earnings season, like last quarter. Negative revisions of earnings estimates by analysts are outnumbering positive revisions by about 2 to 1. He noted in the last two quarters, stocks responded well to earnings news in the beginning of the reporting period but then faded when negative headlines on trade in the latter part of each earnings season.*****&gt; “Expectations seem pretty low. We’ve had analysts’ downward revisions remain elevated, as they’ve been heading into prior warning seasons. But we haven’t necessarily seen the number of warnings from companies rising,” he said. “It could be a positive divergence that analysts are lowering earnings estimates at a higher-than-average rate, but companies aren’t warning at a higher-than-average rate.”*****&gt; Financial companies profits are expected to be up by 1.4%, and real estate is expected to see the best profit growth with a gain of 2.7%, according to Refinitiv. The information technology sector is expected to see a profit decline of 7.6%, and communications is expected to be 1% lower, according to Refinitiv. Materials is expected to see the biggest decline after energy.

Consumer Credit data for the month of August was the only major release on Monday, exceeding expectations, but declining from July’s level. Inflation data took the spotlight this week with the release of PPI, CPI, and export and import prices. Core CPI was inline with the previous month and the import price index’s decline (year over year) was smaller than forecasted, but other readings on inflation were weaker. Likewise, labor data had its share of disappointments as the JOLTS report showed a third consecutive decline in openings, hourly earnings growth slowed, and continuing claims ticked higher. Initial Jobless Claims provided some relief though, coming in at 210K compared to 220K expected and 219K last week. While small business optimism was weaker—NFIB’s index fell to 101.8 from 103.1—consumer sentiment readings from Bloomberg and the University of Michigan both rose with the latter exceeding expectations.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101119-ECO1.png))**&gt; Looking ahead to next week, the calendar is slightly busier with 22 releases on the docket in addition to earnings beginning to ramp up as a total of 115 companies report. There are no scheduled economic releases Monday due to Columbus Day, so next week’s data begins on Tuesday with Empire Manufacturing which is forecasted to fall from 2.0 to 0.5. Other manufacturing gauges, including the Philadelphia Fed’s index and industrial production, are also expected to fall. Retail Sales is scheduled for Wednesday and are expected to rise 0.3%. On Thursday, Housing Starts and Permit data are both expected to show moderation. The leading index is scheduled to round out the week on Friday.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101119-ECO2.png))*******# Fund Flows Favor Fixed Income&gt; This week’s fund flow numbers from the Investment Company Institute showed that the long, steady rotation from equity mutual funds and exchange traded funds to fixed income funds has continued.&gt; As shown below, the spread between equity fund flows and fixed income fund flows has reached a net reading of -$165.9bn over the last three months; that’s among the largest net flow out of equities and into bonds since the data starts.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101119-Flows-1.png))**&gt; Fixed income isn’t the only place that retail has been moving allocations to.

At the start of each earnings season, we publish our list of the most volatile stocks on earnings. Our Earnings Explorer tool contains a huge database that has every single quarterly earnings report for nearly all US-listed stocks going back to 2001. One part of the database tracks the one-day price reaction that stocks experience following their earnings reports, so users are able to easily track how individual stocks typically react to earnings.&gt; In the table below, we show the stocks expected to report within the next month that have historically been the most volatile in reaction to earnings. To make the list, the company had to have at least 20 quarterly reports (5 years) and also have a current share price of $5 or more.&gt; At the top of the list is Telecom equipment maker Infinera (INFN), which is scheduled to report on October 28th after the close. INFN just barely makes the cut because it trades at $5.20/share, but it has historically averaged a one-day absolute change of 15.16% on its historical earnings reaction days. You can expect a big move when it reports at the end of this month. Consumer review website YELP ranks as the second most volatile stock on earnings with an average one-day move of +/-14.85%. Enphase Energy (ENPH), LendingTree (TREE), and Applied Opto (AAOI) round out the top five with average one-day moves of more than +/-13% on their earnings reaction days. Other notables towards the top of the list include Wayfair (W), Netflix (NFLX), and Twitter (TWTR), which all typically move either up or down more than 12% on earnings.&gt; Of the stocks on the list, Enphase (ENPH) is up by far the most in 2019 with a huge gain of 424%. Other stocks like Stamps.com (STMP), ANGI Homeservices (ANGI), and Green Dot (GDOT) are down more than 50% YTD. Twitter (TWTR), Blucora (BCOR), and Benefitfocus (BNFT) have the highest earnings beat rates at more than 90%. While it has a high beat rate, BNFT has been on a wild ride over the past two years, rallying from $24 up to $60 in 2018 before falling all the way back down to $24 as of today. You can bet a big move is in store when it reports on the 31st.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/allvol.png))**&gt; If you're just interested in large-cap names, below is a list of the most volatile S&amp;P 500 stocks on earnings. These are stocks set to report over the next month, and as shown, Netflix (NFLX) is at the top of the list with an average one-day move of +/-12.78% on earnings. Twitter (TWTR), Align Tech (ALGN), TripAdvisor (TRIP), and Akamai (AKAM) rank 2nd through 5th in that order, while other notables include Amazon (AMZN), Advanced Micro (AMD), Chipotle (CMG), Facebook (FB), Electronic Arts (EA), and Wynn Resorts (WYNN).&gt; If you own or have interest in owning any of these names, buckle up because they're likely to experience a big move when they report at some point in the next few weeks!&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/spxvol.png))*******# Key Earnings Reports Over the Next Two Weeks&gt; Our Earnings Calendar is part of our Earnings Explorer tool. The calendar shows the upcoming earnings report dates for US-listed companies over the next month, and investors use it as an easy way to monitor the names they're most interested in. We provide quite a bit of information for each company listed in the calendar, including EPS and sales estimates, its historical beat rates, and its average share price performance on its earnings reaction day. If you ever want to know how a stock typically trades in reaction to its earnings report, this is the place to go.&gt; The Q3 2019 earnings reporting period finally kicks off next week when most of the big banks are set to report. But the biggest weeks for earnings will come in the back half of October and the first couple weeks of November. As shown in the chart below, the week of October 28th through November 1st is the busiest of them all when we'll see hundreds of companies report each day.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/calen.png))**&gt; Below is a list pulled from our Earnings Calendar of the key earnings reports to watch next week (based on market cap). There are no key reports to speak of on Monday the 14th due to Columbus Day, but on Tuesday we'll hear from Citigroup (C), Goldman (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and UnitedHealth (UNH) all before the open. On Wednesday, we'll get results from Bank of America (BAC) in the morning and then IBM and Netflix (NFLX) after the close, while on Thursday we'll hear from Morgan Stanley (MS), which will be the last of the major banks and brokers to report next week. American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO), and Schlumberger (SLB) will finish off the week with reports on Friday morning.&gt; Of the key stocks reporting next week, Goldman (GS), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and UnitedHealth (UNH) beat EPS estimates the most often at more than 90% of the time. In terms of price reactions, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) -- which reports on Thursday afternoon -- has historically reacted the most positively to earnings with an average one-day gain of 3.24%. Bank of America (BAC) has the weakest price reaction to earnings with an average one-day drop of 0.95%.&gt; In terms of earnings volatility, Netflix (NFLX) takes the cake with an average absolute one-day change of 12.78% on its earnings reaction day.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/key-reports-next-week-use.png))**&gt; The following week (10/21-10/25) is when we'll really be in the heart of the Q3 reporting period. A large number of Dow 30 stocks will report that week, including big blue chips like McDonald's (MCD), United Tech (UTX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Intel (INTC), and Microsoft (MSFT). The most important report of the week will come on Thursday the 24th when Amazon (AMZN) announces after the close. AMZN is currently expected to announce earnings of $7.19/share and revenues of $68.7 billion for the quarter. AMZN doesn't have an abnormally high EPS beat rate at just 62.5%, but it is typically a very volatile name as its average one-day move on earnings has historically been nearly +/-10%. Just think, a 10% move for AMZN is a $174 swing in either direction based on its current share price.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/key10211025.png))*******# Is October Really Scary?&gt; Just like that, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell more than 1% on the first day of October. The rough start has many investors on edge, as October is known for spectacular crashes—specifically 1929, 1987, and 2008.&gt; On the flipside, September 2019 was historically calm for equity markets, as the S&amp;P 500 didn’t fall 1% on a single day the entire month.&gt; “The lack of any volatility in September could mean the usually volatile month of October could be due for some big swings,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The good news, though, is while October has had a bad rap for some big drops, over the past 20 years, it actually has been the third best month of the year for stocks.”&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, October has quietly been one of the strongest months of the year over the past 10 and 20 years. Going back to 1950, it ranks as the seventh strongest month of the year, so right near the middle of the pack.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/october-stocks_2019.png?ssl=1))**&gt; Four other things to consider:Since 1950, no month has had more 1% moves (higher or lower) than October.Since 1928, 6 of the 10 worst single-day drops have taken place in October; however, 3 of the 10 best days ever occurred in October as well.This is a pre-election year, and as the chart above shows, October’s average returns in a pre-election year have been muted since 1950. The catch here is that this average return is greatly impacted by the 21.8% drop in 1987. The median return is actually quite respectable.October has been higher during a pre-election year every year since 1999, with an average return of an impressive 6.5%.*****# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 11th, 2019**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.13.19**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)*****Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-*****&gt; * **$NFLX**&gt; * **$JPM**&gt; * **$UNH**&gt; * **$C**&gt; * **$BAC**&gt; * **$JNJ**&gt; * **$GS**&gt; * **$WFC**&gt; * **$APHA**&gt; * **$SCHW**&gt; * **$ALLY**&gt; * **$ABT**&gt; * **$BLK**&gt; * **$KO**&gt; * **$PLD**&gt; * **$UAL**&gt; * **$PM**&gt; * **$WIT**&gt; * **$MS**&gt; * **$IBM**&gt; * **$AXP**&gt; * **$FHN**&gt; * **$FRC**&gt; * **$URI**&gt; * **$SLB**&gt; * **$HON**&gt; * **$CSX**&gt; * **$PNC**&gt; * **$UNP**&gt; * **$TEAM**&gt; * **$AA**&gt; * **$USB**&gt; * **$ISRG**&gt; * **$ERIC**&gt; * **$CCI**&gt; * **$BK**&gt; * **$ASML**&gt; * **$JBHT**&gt; * **$CMA**&gt; * **$TSM**&gt; * **$TXT**&gt; * **$SNBR**&gt; * **$BBT**&gt; * **$MBWM**&gt; * **$GPC**&gt; * **$KMI**&gt; * **$KEY*******###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/aba1Nd2.png))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/PuhtXaX.png))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/YRRM2LU.png))*******Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:*****&gt; # ***Monday 10.14.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())NONE.&gt; # ***Monday 10.14.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())NONE.*****&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.15.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/MJWa86V.png))&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.15.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Zu9Ow0t.png))*****&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.16.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/eam8p95.png))&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.16.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/KOCx48P.png))*****&gt; # ***Thursday 10.17.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/R3sTSi2.png))&gt; # ***Thursday 10.17.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/blMe0PL.png))*****&gt; # ***Friday 10.18.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8WY2fuA.png))*****&gt; # ***Friday 10.18.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())NONE.*****# Netflix, Inc. $282.93&gt; **Netflix, Inc.

About twenty years ago, I had just graduated college. My grandfather had died years ago,  and he had left me a small amount to invest which was an account that, now graduated, I had access to. He had utilized a stock broker  and I was to  meet  with him.I was on a bit of a  tear.  I had just gotten my liberal arts degree, and  thought  I was  super smart.  And in all the arrogance of a sure-fire smart “kid” coming out of a liberal arts school and still buzzing a bit from the dotcom boom,  I  learned that I could make my own trades for 29.95 using s new site called “E*Trade”.  I spoke to my Dad about it, he said, talk to  broker,  but if that’s what you want to, do, it’s  your money (sort of with the whole, I wouldn’t do it, but go for it, I guess, attitude) I spoke to the broker for  the first time, and  after his pitch of  what the portfolio had done in the last five years and some  stocks I was going buy, it all sounded reasonable and good.  He seemed to know what he was talking about, but I still, in my  pushy arrogance of late adolescence , inquired how much I paid him per trade.  it  was considerably more than 30 dollars. I then asked if  I could make some suggestions  as to what we could buy.“What were you thinking of?”“Apple, for one,” I said.“Oh no, I don’t know about that.  They’ve had a lot of issues the last few years, and I wouldn’t recommend it.”More due to cost differential per trade than this vague analysis, I told him I think I’m going to go my own way.   I put about 1200 bucks into Apple, some less into the online book store  “amazon”, and a couple of index funds,  and a few other companies, that I  thought had a lot interesting hype around them.Sure enough, my apple investment looked horrible to start, losing about 40%  of  the value  within three months.  Same with Amazon.  I decided, though, to do nothing, and I was onto do different things.  I never  sold those shares, and today they’ve are  pretty close to appreciating to  10,000%.  I bought Apple a few more times throughout my life, and that  one stock has accrued in value (I mean, all of it theoretical, I suppose, unless I do sell)  about the same for me  than my paychecks throughout my career.I have generally  picked winners. I own shares in Sam Adams, in Tesla, in google, in facebook, in nvidia, etc.  and still have those index funds, that did quite well as everything has over  the last twenty years. What’s the lesson in all of this? I don’t think there is one. Get lucky. Don’t sell. And listen to  yourself, I  guess.
What are your thoughts on Apples price movements? The stock is down over 15% from its ATH, after reporting a monster quarter. Are they still overvalued? Or is now the time to “buy the dip”?Of course we know nothing - but I am curious to hear sentiment on this stock. CNBC constantly name drops Apple to guests and guests always skip Apple and speak on Alphabet, Fb, or Microsoft.Are you waiting to purchase?
OK, now tell me why it's crap... (any feedback would be helpful)- 40% VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market, .03% fee)- 15% IEMG Emerging Market ETF including Korea, 0.14% fee)- 15% Amazon- 5% Apple- 5% Boeing- 5% Activision Blizzard- 5% TWMJF Canopy Growth Corp- 5% S&amp;P Biotech Index ETF equal waited (.35% fee)- 5% AMD
It is all about studies and research when it comes to being a good investor or trader. There are too many parameters to fit into one blog that might help you understand and analyze the market. Even after years of research, you will still have topics left to learn.After spending a lot of time and money on research, investment analysts and advisors are always looking for strategies which will outperform the market sentiments at any given period of time. Most of the sectors failed to outperform the [S&amp;P500 index's performance](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/markets_sectors/sectors/si_performance.jhtml?tab=siperformance) except for Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, Financials, and Information Technology sector.So, if the experts and fund managers cannot beat the market sentiments, what are the odds of us beating the market?Well, even when things seem to go south, there are a few investment techniques backed by research and also time-tested which tends to outperform the market sentiments. They might prove to be a good investment and generate consistent incomes.1. [Stocks paying dividends](https://www.agrud.com/analytics/us-equities/sp500-highest-dividend-yield) tend to outperform the market: A study by Ned Davis Research found that dividend-paying stocks tend to give better returns and beat the market sentiment over a longer period of time than stocks who don't pay dividends.Stocks in S&amp;P500 that did not pay dividends gave a 2.5% annual return from 1972 through 2015 whereas a dividend-paying stock gained 7.4% annually.2. Stocks buy-back plans also tend to outperform: Companies that repurchase their own shares generally generates higher returns. As a company buys back its own shares the outstanding shares goes down resulting in an increase in a value of its own shares even if there is not enough income.On May 1, Apple announced a buy-back program to repurchase stocks worth $100 billion. The stock price was $169.10 during close on that day and the prices surged by 10.02% to $186.05 within a week and were up by 12.59% by the last trading day.3. Buy and Hold strategy: Research shows that buying a stock and holding it for a longer stretch of time is one of the best ways to make money in the long run as well as it is a low-risk strategy. An Oppenheimer study shows that S&amp;P500 never lost in the long run over a 20 year period of time back till 1950 whereas lost 16 times in the short run.A research by Morningstar shows that if any person invested in any in 30 of the biggest rallied days in the stock market, he would have made 1/5th of the money than the person who held in throughout.4. Dividend Reinvestment: Dividend reinvestment will help you in the compound growth. When you reinvest your dividend to buy more shares, you eventually end up owning more shares that will generate more dividends.I’m not some investment mogul or expert, but someone just like you. Even though no strategies can give you guaranteed returns, these sets of strategies generally outperform the market. In short, you might try identifying companies that provide dividends and has regular buy-back plans. Hold your stock for a longer period of time and try reinvesting your dividends. Patience might give you a great reward after a long run.
I already own Amazon, Google, Nvidia. Considering AMD. I'm trying to find good hidden stocks with a lot of potential in AI but every resource I look at just points me to these (+Apple, Baidu, maybe FB).Are there any small unknown companies doing AI that can be huge?
Graph of this issue:https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DicAwRmVsAAd97J.jpgThis chart shows that the five largest S&amp;P 500 stocks have a market capitalization equal to the bottom 282 S&amp;P 500 stocks. This turned out to be something of a Rorschach test, which was not my intention. I just thought it was a powerful visual. I wasn’t really trying to make a point, certainly not the point that many thought I was going for.The reason I made that chart was because I was working on this post today, which will  attempt to show that there are plenty of other stocks outside of FAANG that are doing just fine. That tweet had the opposite effect. Hopefully this will remedy that.The chart below shows the average returns of S&amp;P 500 stocks year-to-date broken down by market cap decile. The first decile is the 50 largest stocks, the second decile is the next 50 largest stocks, and so on. You can plainly see that while the mega caps are performing well, and powering the index higher, there are other stocks that are doing just fine. The 4th, 6th, and 7th deciles are performing better than the 2nd and 3rd.It is pretty wild to think that the five largest stocks are as large as the bottom 282 S&amp;P 500 stocks, but the truth is, this is how a cap weighted index works. Yum! Brands can triple and it still would not move the needle of the index as much as if Apple gains 1%.We are not in uncharted territory. The Pareto Principle is a feature of financial markets, not a bug.Do you think the largest S&amp;P 500 stocks will continue to be equally big and dominant, in market cap, in the future?
Qcom and Apple finally reached a settlement. Qcomup 16%
Not a very diversified  portfolio but I feel comfortable holding these companies even when the market goes down.$3,000 each  for S&amp;P 500 index fund, Facebook, Apple$2,500 each for Visa, Bank of America$2,000 each for Microsoft, Amazon, Intel
So they make billions and billions and don't know what to spend it on, why is dividend so low? Is it just because only the US made profit was distributed and all the international profit was held abroad awaiting tax holiday?

Amazon hits $1 trillion market value.Amazon hits $1 trillion valuation8 Mins Ago | 00:54Amazon market cap hit $1 trillion on Tuesday, becoming the second publicly traded U.S. company to reach the record valuation after Apple.Shares of the e-commerce giant rose nearly 2 percent to a high of $2,050.50 in morning trading. The stock needed a price of $2,050.27 to reach the $1 trillion mark, based on an outstanding share count of 487,741,189 shares — according to the company's most recent quarterly report in July.Apple reached $1 trillion in early August after posting a strong quarterly report. It took Amazon just five weeks to match the milestone.The two Silicon Valley giants had been racing to the trillion-dollar finish line. Apple had a pretty significant head start,surpassing $900 billion in market value eight months before Amazon, which reached $900 billion in July on the heels of its biggest Prime Day ever.Amazon stock has gained more than 70 percent in 2018 and has more than doubled in the last 12 months. That dwarfs gains by the overall market, with the S&amp;P 500 index gaining 8 percent this year and 16 percent in the last 12 months.How high will Amazon go, do you think?
Hello,Mid twenty’s and I invested for the first time about 2yrs ago. All my stocks below have 30-150% profits.

Or do I take the profits and wait until the market drops and re invest?  I struggle with nobody has been hurt taking a profit vs I got in at such a good price point that even if the market drops I wouldn’t be able to buy it as cheap as I got in so I should hold until I’m old.NetflixAppleAmazonGoogleDr PepperFacebookMicrosoftWalmartFedexLower Profits marginsVerizonSouthwestVisaTysonThank you for the feedback.

**Value Stocks**The Stars Group (TSG) is up 33% this week after announcing a planned combination with Flutter Entertainment PLC, the owner of Paddy Power in the UK and Ireland. Flutter is getting a good deal, evidenced by a 6.6% jump in its own stock price, it is buying flutter for about 7x adjusted EBITDA before synergies.But TSG share holders also look set to benefit from this deal as;* TSG’s stock price has languished since it over paid for Sky Betting and took on too much debt. Flutter has much more reasonable debt levels and will be able to share the burden.* TSG’s shareholders will benefit (along with Flutter stock holders) from a rise in Flutter since they are to receive 0.2253 shares in this all stock deal.* Both entities will benefit from cost savings and the potential opportunity to dominate online betting in both Europe and the US.That market in the US alone has been estimated at between $7 billion to $9 billion. Competition will be fierce but the opportunity should allow strong double digit growth for years to come and make the current valuation (even after this weeks rise) of just 9.2x current year estimates look far too cheap.**Insider Buying**On Monday, Barron’s reported that four directors (later joined by a fifth) purchased stock in GameStop Corp in the first open-market purchases by insiders since September of 2016.The purchases were mostly above $5.00 and, even though the stock has since risen to $5.55, investors may still be interested as the stock has fallen around 66% this year. The company has been hit by an unrelenting slump in sales as customers switch to buying games online. However the outlook has some rays of light as the company should receive a boost by the launch of new consoles planned for next year.**Acquisition**Cedar Fair fell on Friday after the theme park operator turned down a $4 billion offer from Six Flags Entertainment, claiming it was inadequate. The stock closed on Friday with a market cap of $3.23 billion and there was no indication of a raised offer being forthcoming. However with synergies driving the deal, and with SG&amp;A expenses of around 15% revenues (and 120% net income), a compromise might yet be reached.**Large Caps**HP Inc dropped almost 10% on Friday (to $16.64) after the company announced a bold new strategy to reduce its workforce by 16% as part of a broad restructuring meant to cut costs and boost sales growth. HP announced that it expects profit, excluding restructuring costs and other items, to be $2.22 to $2.32 a share in fiscal 2020 (slightly above consensus $2.24). HP’s board also boosted the company’s share repurchasing plan by $5 billion on top of the $1.7 billion remaining on its existing plan. That looks significant compared to its current market cap of just under $25 billion.The market was not impressed by the announcement but, if management are successful, the stock looks cheap at less than 7.5x forward earnings. Incoming CEO Enrique Lores (who is a long standing company man with about 30 years at the firm) said “We are really confident about the future of the company.”**Speculative Opportunity**Meet Group stock price jumped almost 25% on Thursday after the company raised Q3 guidance with CEO of Meet Group, Geoff Cook saying that "New features including streamer levels, VIP badges, first time buyer bonuses and one-on-one video chat are contributing to meaningful business results. Further, we believe that the moderation-related headwinds related to our recent safety enhancements are largely behind us.”Putting the moderation-related headwinds behind them is key as the stock price dropped a few months ago due to concerns that its app was too racy for Apple and Google and might even be banned. The firm has taken steps to address those concerns and now has industry-leading safety practices including a prominent alert button for abuse reporting which sends a screenshot to Meet’s 200 moderation employees for immediate review.While Q2 results were reasonable, the updated Q3 guidance reassures investors that management’s eye is back on the ball trying to grow profits. Especially since Mr Cook also said he expected a strong Q4 "Given the ongoing stabilization in our advertising business, we anticipate a seasonally strong fourth quarter in advertising,"**Growth Stocks/High risk and speculative**On Wednesday Zynex Inc, the non-invasive medical device company for pain management, announced 95% year over year order growth for the third quarter. CEO Thomas Sandgaard attributed the rise to the company's expansion of its sales force which has doubled over the past couple of years.That’s key because the company has reported its goal to grow to 400 sales employees over the next few years and expects each to generate $1 million of sales. Margins in this business are healthy and should improve as the business grows. Gross margins were 80% at the last quarter and net margins 28%. Hitting the $400 million revenue target should generate net income well in excess of $100 million. In comparison, the stocks valuation at Friday’s close was just 3.65x that figure at $365 million.Please feel free to “FOLLOW” me if you would like to see my regular updates during the week.This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.

A U.S. judge orders a new trial between Samsung (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNNF) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to determine how much Samsung owes for copying the iPhone’s appearance.The Supreme Court previously said Samsung should pay up $399M because damages only applied to patented parts of the device that were copied rather than the whole device. The $399M was a portion of the original $548M Samsung gave Apple in December 2015.U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh says jury instructions at the prior trial had not reflected the law accurately and could have prejudiced jurors against Samsung.
Hey what's happening r/stocks! Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 13th, 2019.# **What to watch in the week ahead: Trade chatter, key economic data and Walmart earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/what-to-watch-in-the-week-ahead-trade-chatter-key-economic-data-and-walmart-earnings.html)*******&gt; Important data on the consumer and manufacturing is released in the week ahead, and investors are watching to see what it says about two key parts of the economy as new tariffs go into effect on Chinese goods.*****&gt; The economic reports should show how the economy is faring so far in the second quarter, following a surprisingly strong first quarter. Analysts say the better economy gave President Donald Trump some leverage in his trade negotiations with China.*****&gt; But it's the progress of those trade negotiations that the markets care about most in the week ahead, after investors were surprised by a lack of progress in the talks and new tariffs this past week.*****&gt; On Friday, stocks erased steep losses and bounced higher after both Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trump called the first negotiating session following new tariffs "constructive."*****&gt; Retail sales for April are released Wednesday, and should give a good view of consumer spending as the second quarter got underway. Also on Wednesday, industrial production, business inventories and the Empire State manufacturing survey are reported. Consumers sentiment is out Friday. Besides the data, there are just a few earnings, with Walmart reporting Thursday, and Macy's on Wednesday.*****&gt; Stocks closed out a volatile week lower, and the S&amp;P 500's 2.2% decline was still its worst of the year.*****&gt; "The odds of something going wrong are much higher today than they were last Friday, when there was pretty much consensus that a [trade] deal was going to be done," said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.*****&gt; But strategists say the selling could have been even worse in the past week. They said stocks were supported by investor confidence that a deal will get done, and also the expectation that Trump would take action to avoid a market collapse.*****&gt; "I still think that the risks are perhaps skewed more to the downside, than the upside here. Whether it will escalate further is hard to handicap from a risk perspective," Keon said. The Trump administration has complained that China attempted to renegotiate their deal, so Trump raised tariffs to 25% on $200 billion in goods and threatens tariffs on $300 billion more.*****&gt; Whether the Chinese have changed their view, or their lack of agreement on some issues is just posturing is yet to be seen, Keon said.*****&gt; "The U.S. and China are rivals and are going to be economic rivals for many years to come. Doing a trade deal is going to be like the Yankees and Red Sox doing a trade deal. Nobody wants to be the guy who trades away Babe Ruth," he said.*****&gt; Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said it's not unusual for trade negotiations to hit a rough spot, as they near the finish line. "What really matters is whether you have those tariffs on for quite some time. Companies have been doing fairly well managing tariffs, whether it's by supply lines or price. The uncertainty is the problem for firms," he said.*****&gt; Tilley said he expects to see strength in the retail sales. Manufacturing data could be soft.*****&gt; "Our take is that the consumer is still in a very good place. We think a lot of the volatility, some of it was real in the sense it was the government shutdown and the movement of the stock market through December. There were some seasonal adjustments," he said.*****&gt; Analysts have said the fact the stock market was at a record high; first quarter growth was a strong 3.2%, and unemployment fell to a 50-year low of 3.6%, all likely emboldened Trump to play hardball with China. Likewise, improving economic data in China could have made Beijing believe it had a stronger hand.*****&gt; For now, markets are watching to see whether talks continue to be constructive or whether the two sides focus on retaliation.*****&gt; Tilley said he expects to see a deal, but if it looks like Trump will move forward with tariffs on all Chinese goods, he would reconsider his stock positions. "If that was coming and we thought that was going to be in place for some time, we would be forced to reevaluate and downgraded our economic outlook and also the outlook for the markets," said Tilley.*****# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://finviz.com/publish/051119/sec_all_w1_075084162.png))**# **Major Indices for this past week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/RTtU1yT.png))**# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/66IZoUM.png))**# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/vUzEEA7.png))**# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hxemRbp.png))**# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/l8WQMcG.png))**# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EhrciC1.png))**# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FQ5X0cR.png))**# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K8WRgC6.png))**# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7Ui6753.png))**# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9TrCzDM.png))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8Sfe6Jw.png))*******# Earnings Estimates Stand Firm&gt; Earnings growth projections have remained positive globally, even as trade tensions have rattled financial markets this week.&gt; Lately, headlines on the U.S.-China trade dispute have distracted investors, and a few pockets of the global economy have weakened over the last several months. Fixed income markets have positioned for a marked economic slowdown with the yield curve again nearing inversion (long-term rates falling below short-term rates).&gt; Uncertainty can be uncomfortable, but in times of market volatility, we encourage investors to focus on long-term fundamentals instead of short-term noise. One of the fundamental pillars we like to focus on is company earnings.&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, earnings in all three major global regions are expected to rise this year. U.S. companies are poised to lead, with consensus expectations for 4.2% profit growth in 2019.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/U.S.-Leads-Earnings-Growth-Prospects-for-2019-1.png?ssl=1))**&gt; “The bar for earnings results is low because of heightened uncertainty,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Economic growth may be moderating internationally, but we see enough catalysts ahead to drive another year of record profits in the U.S.”&gt; U.S. company profits escaped last quarter’s soft patch, based on earnings results from about 85% of constituents that have already reported. S&amp;P 500 Index profits likely grew about 1% year over year in the first quarter of 2019, markedly better than the 2–4% decline expected at the beginning of the reporting season, depending on the data source. Better-than-feared earnings have helped push the S&amp;P 500 to all-time highs over the past few weeks and we expect improving earnings to carry stocks going forward.&gt; Earnings expectations for developed and emerging markets (EM) are below U.S. projections. However, we think EM earnings projections may be too pessimistic. Global market volatility, trade tensions, and a strong U.S. dollar have contributed to reduced EM growth expectations in recent months, but we think the Federal Reserve’s pause should help cap gains in the U.S. dollar and help fuel stronger global currencies and EM economic activity.*****# Uncomfortable, but Expected&gt; Trade tensions have flared up again, and they’ve caught the stock market off guard.&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has dropped 2.1% over the past two days amid a slew of trade-related headlines. On May 6, the United States announced it would implement additional tariffs on Chinese imports at the end of the week if no trade agreement is reached. In response, China threatened its own retaliatory measures. China and U.S. officials are still scheduled to continue trade talks in Washington, D.C. May 9, but the threat of escalation looms large in investors’ minds.&gt; Recent market volatility has been uncomfortable, but not particularly surprising given the lack of turbulence year to date. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500’s largest pullback this year has been unusually small relative to previous years. Since 1970, the S&amp;P 500 has made it through the first five months of the year without at least a 2.5% pullback only once—in 1995.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019s-Biggest-Drawdown-is-the-Smallest-Since-1995.png?ssl=1))**&gt; On average, the S&amp;P 500 has endured an 8.5% pullback from January to May each year. This year, stocks haven’t come close to that. The largest S&amp;P 500 pullback this year has been a one-day slide of 2.48%.&gt; “Given the recent run we’ve had, we believe conditions are ripe for an increase in volatility,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Though we remain optimistic about U.S. stocks’ longer-term prospects, stocks recently reached overbought levels.”&gt; While volatility could take over in the near term, we see the resurgence in trade risk as a temporary obstacle to new S&amp;P 500 highs later this year. In our view, current trade headwinds will have a negligible impact on economic growth, and the U.S. economy has emerged relatively unscathed from what is traditionally the weakest quarter of the year. Economic fundamentals also point to higher prices: The labor market is steadily improving, corporate profits are at all-time highs, and inflation is healthy.&gt; In the meanwhile, we look for S&amp;P 500 support in the 2,775 range, the index’s 200-day moving average. If this level were to be reached, it would represent a 6% slide from record levels, and at the low range of a typical 6-10% market correction. Solid fundamentals and technical support may provide investors with potential for relief from the recent bout of market volatility.*****# May Option Expiration Week: Recent Weakness&gt; Trading around May option expiration is mostly a mixed bag. DJIA has been down nineteen of the last thirty-seven May expiration days with an average loss of 0.12%. The full-week has a bearish bias for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 with records of 20 declines and 17 advances over the past 37 years. More recently, DJIA has suffered declines in eight of the past ten expiration weeks.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a34c68045be0c0b1ff4548470db7a75d/tumblr_inline_prb1ioDfJZ1spdppr_500.jpg))**&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b27a001af1e4f0617690195460291d2a/tumblr_inline_prb1j7CIgQ1spdppr_500.jpg))**&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7736d2601290b6096f7cabca78c27e4/tumblr_inline_prb1jhTzF91spdppr_500.jpg))*******# Rotate in May — Top Sectors for the “Worst Months” May to October&gt; Today we are not going to bother debating whether one should actually sell in May or not. Instead, let’s focus on some tactical adjustments that can be made in portfolios to take advantage of what actually does work during the “Worst Six Months” while either shorting or outright avoiding what does not work all that frequently.&gt; In the following table, the performance of the S&amp;P 500 during the “Worst Six Months” May to October is compared to fourteen select sector indices or sub-indices, gold and the 30-year Treasury bond. Nine of the fourteen indices chosen are S&amp;P Sector indices. Gold and 30-year bond are continuously-linked, non-adjusted front-month futures contracts. With the exception of two indices, 1990-2018, a full 29 years of data was selected. This selection represents a reasonably balanced number of bull and bear years for each and a long enough timeframe to be statistically significant while representing current trends. In an effort to make an apple-to-apple comparison, dividends are not included in this study.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef156141ee3a14742dbf8c91837f80f/tumblr_inline_pr9c02KFIg1spdppr_500.jpg))**&gt; Using the S&amp;P 500 as the baseline by which all others were compared, five indices and the 30-year Treasury bond outperformed during the “Worst Six Months” while nine others and gold underperformed based upon “AVG %” return. At the top of the list are Biotech and Healthcare with average gains of 8.69% and 4.85% during the “Worst Months.” However, before jumping into Biotech positions, only 24 years of data was available and in those years, Biotech was up just 54.2% of the time from May through October. Some years, like 2014, gains were massive while in down years losses were frequently nearly as large. Although not the best sector by AVG %, Consumer Staples advancing 79.3% of the time is the closest thing to a sure bet for a gain during the “Worst Months.”*****# Market Celebrates Mother’s Day with Gains&gt; Over the last twenty-four years on the Friday before Mother’s Day the Dow Jones Industrials have gained ground sixteen times. On the Monday after, DJIA has advanced seventeen times. Average gain on Friday has been 0.19% and a respectable 0.49% on Monday. However, in four of the last seven years, the Monday following Mother’s Day has been down.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6949bf7582792d744e6caf5571ce504a/tumblr_inline_pr7b9bWGA61spdppr_500.jpg))*******# Relax It’s May Not China Trade War Fears&gt; A full blown trade war with China is not in anyone’s interest. President Trump’s negotiating style may be unsettling to the market at times, but neither country is likely to stand on ceremony to save face at the risk to their respective economies and markets. With the market at new highs and up big the first four months this year it is even more prone to short-term weakness in May.&gt; Our overall outlook for the year remains bullish as it has been since our Annual Forecastin December that was followed by a bullish January Indicator Trifecta. The historical strength of Pre-Election Years, which has been self-evident thus far this year, is supported by resilient economic and corporate readings, a dovish Fed clearly done with raising interest rates for the time being and a White House that is supportive of Wall Street. But, as you can see in the chart of Pre-Election Year Seasonal Patterns below, the Dow (black dotted line) and S&amp;P (green dotted line) are already at historical average gains for the Pre-Election year and NASDAQ is way ahead of the pace up more than 20% for 2019 to date.&gt; Ostensibly, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ are on the brink of clearing the last levels of resistance. But the Dow is struggling and Russell 2000 is well off the pace. S&amp;P and NASDAQ made new all-time highs last month, but are straining to hold those levels and there is chatter in technical analysis circles about a bearish double top forming on the S&amp;P and NASDAQ. Also evident in the chart here is the weakness often experienced in the latter part of May. So while we remain bullish on the year, we do expect the market to be weaker during the May soft patch and backing and filing during the Worst 4 Months July-October.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c97a2af90145417a9030378aabff777c/tumblr_inline_pr3nnoML6C1spdppr_500.jpg))*******# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for May 10th, 2019**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 05.12.19**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)*****Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-*****&gt; * **$NVDA**&gt; * **$BABA**&gt; * **$ACB**&gt; * **$CSCO**&gt; * **$IQ**&gt; * **$BIDU**&gt; * **$WMT**&gt; * **$TTWO**&gt; * **$AMAT**&gt; * **$CYBR**&gt; * **$TLRY**&gt; * **$STNE**&gt; * **$M**&gt; * **$RL**&gt; * **$BILI**&gt; * **$LEGH**&gt; * **$WIX**&gt; * **$DE**&gt; * **$CPRX**&gt; * **$TME**&gt; * **$EAST**&gt; * **$LMB**&gt; * **$MYO**&gt; * **$KEM**&gt; * **$AZZ**&gt; * **$A**&gt; * **$PAGS**&gt; * **$MEEC**&gt; * **$MIME**&gt; * **$NTES**&gt; * **$CTST**&gt; * **$DARE**&gt; * **$CRMD**&gt; * **$TSG**&gt; * **$CPLP**&gt; * **$CELP**&gt; * **$BOOT**&gt; * **$NEWR**&gt; * **$GDS**&gt; * **$SESN**&gt; * **$AKTS**&gt; * **$LM**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K8WRgC6.png))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/G2FWNOI.png))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S MOST NOTABLE PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q9yldQz.jpg))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/bViqZmD.png))*******Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:*****&gt; # ***Monday 5.13.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tx28j1z.png))&gt; # ***Monday 5.13.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eILBKWq.png))*****&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.14.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WAnmlba.png))&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.14.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vZzvy6a.png))*****&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.15.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sxy6Llf.png))&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.15.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/p4wLGmX.png))*****&gt; # ***Thursday 5.16.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SNhen2b.png))&gt; # ***Thursday 5.16.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjJ8ii2.png))*****&gt; # ***Friday 5.17.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/l9zdL1d.png))*****&gt; # ***Friday 5.17.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())NONE.*****# NVIDIA Corp. $168.82&gt; **NVIDIA Corp.

I'll start by providing a chronological history of the company, then I'll explain the three pillars of Score Media and Gaming which drive the company today and some further context.Their History:* 1993 - They launched SportScope, a Canadian TV channel with a sports ticker/scroll banner at the bottom.* 1997 - SportScope morphs into Headline Sports.* 2000 - Headline Sports morphs into "the Score Television Network".* 2007 - theScore is the first multisport news and data app launched on Apple App Store.* 2011 - theScore established itself as market leader in the mobile sports coverage space with 1 million active users.* 2012 - theScore Inc is created after theScore sells its TV company "theScore Television Network" to  Rogers Communications.* 2015 - theScore creates its eSports platform on YouTube.* 2019 - They partner with Bet.Works to create betting backend technology. They launch sports betting in New Jersey in partnership with Monmouth Racetrack, becoming the first and only US media company to create and operate a mobile sportsbook. They also enter into a strategic multi-State market access partnership with Penn National Gaming* 2020 - They launch sports betting in Colorado and Indiana and up list from TSXV to TSX.* 2021 - They've launched in Iowa and have announced their IPO for the NASDAQ. They stated that there will be more state expansions to come this year for theScore Bet.**The three pillars***theScore** theScore app is one of the most popular mobile sports apps in North America, ranking 3rd in North America and in Canada among multi-sport news and data applications. In Canada, theScore app had approximately double the users of its closest competitors, TSN and Sportsnet, and approximately ten times the users of ESPN’s app.* theScore app generated approximately 3.7 billion user sessions over the last year, with average monthly sessions per active user growing at approximately 9% from 2016 to present.* Users of theScore app engaged with the application for approximately 101 minutes per month on average, ranking first among their peers* Their user chat features are very popular, particularly among users focused on sports betting, with approximately 48% of users who chat sending betting-related messages, and approximately 40% of their overall monthly active users consuming public chat content.* They recently announced their all time record in revenue generated from ads in their app.*theScore esports** theScore esports produces and shares original videocontent pieces across its web and social platforms, including features and documentaries on high-profile teams, games and players from across the world of esports, as well as highlights and interviews. theScore esports’ video content is distributed across YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.* They have approximately 1.6 million subscribers to their YouTube channel.* 1.1 million followers on TikTok as of Dec 2020* Their esports video content generated approximately 357 million views across all channels during the three-month period which ended November 30, 2020. Representing a 358% year-over-year growth in total views of their esports video content from the same period last year.* Worldwide, it's estimated that 495 million people watched esports online or on television in 2020, and that viewership could grow up to 646 million people annually by 2023. As a result of growth of interest in younger generations of sports fans, it is estimated that esports will become one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long-term.*theScore Bet** theScore Bet is authorized to provide sports betting services in New Jersey, Colorado, Indiana, and in Iowa. They also have market access for up to nine additional states via their multi-state market access agreements with Penn National Gaming* theScore Bet has market access to operate an online casino in New Jersey via a multi-year agreement with Twin River Worldwide Holdings, Inc. and anticipates launching its product in the state in the second half of calendar 2021. This is important because* Approximately 50% of users of theScore Bet on iOS devices are also users of theScore app, engaging with their content and their integrated media and betting ecosystem. This means that because they already have the userbase through their media that they don't have to spend as much on marketing compared to their competitors.* The total online gross gaming revenue generated in the United States is estimated to reach approximately $18 billion, of which approximately $6.4 billion is estimated to be generated in the states covered by their market access agreements.**Further Context:**Canada is on the brink of legalizing single event sports betting through bill C-218. It passed the 2nd reading by a vote of 303 and 15. It's estimated that wagering will begin by September (Start of the NFL). This is important for thescore because of their strong Canadian user base.On February 11 2021 theScore completed a 10-1 share consolidation for the purpose of up-listing to the NASDAQ. They announced their IPO this week ~~and several sources indicate that their pricing will take place tomorrow. Usually the stock starts trading 1 day after the pricing, therefore it will start trading on the NASDAQ on Friday. I expect to receive an official statement from theScore tomorrow.~~ The stock will trade under SCR on the TSX and the NAS.The two key factors to their success as a betting company will rely strongly on the integrations between their media and betting platforms which no other company can compete with and their massive user base from their sports media app converting to bettors. As I stated above, almost 50% of the users who chat via their media app also bet.SCR'S market cap currently sits at 1.64B, in comparison DKNG sits at 23.61B and PENN sits at 18.69.This shows the kind of opportunity that theScore has and the unique position that it is placed in.EDIT: theScore [announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thescore-announces-pricing-upsized-initial-010000199.html) that they will be trading on the NASDAQ as of FEBRUARY 25. The IPO price is listed at $27
