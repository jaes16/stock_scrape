Would presume over the last 3 to 4 years the losses of those betting against Tesla would be much higher than 38 billion.Also over the last year, anyone betting against the FAANG+M stocks would have been decimated.So why is the Popular Meme stock so important? If Apple market cap goes down 1 percent it probably same loss as the shorts had against the popular stock.Edit: thanks for all the replies and insight. Much appreciated.
