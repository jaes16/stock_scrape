Hey what's happening r/stocks! Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 13th, 2019.# **What to watch in the week ahead: Trade chatter, key economic data and Walmart earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/what-to-watch-in-the-week-ahead-trade-chatter-key-economic-data-and-walmart-earnings.html)*******&gt; Important data on the consumer and manufacturing is released in the week ahead, and investors are watching to see what it says about two key parts of the economy as new tariffs go into effect on Chinese goods.*****&gt; The economic reports should show how the economy is faring so far in the second quarter, following a surprisingly strong first quarter. Analysts say the better economy gave President Donald Trump some leverage in his trade negotiations with China.*****&gt; But it's the progress of those trade negotiations that the markets care about most in the week ahead, after investors were surprised by a lack of progress in the talks and new tariffs this past week.*****&gt; On Friday, stocks erased steep losses and bounced higher after both Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trump called the first negotiating session following new tariffs "constructive."*****&gt; Retail sales for April are released Wednesday, and should give a good view of consumer spending as the second quarter got underway. Also on Wednesday, industrial production, business inventories and the Empire State manufacturing survey are reported. Consumers sentiment is out Friday. Besides the data, there are just a few earnings, with Walmart reporting Thursday, and Macy's on Wednesday.*****&gt; Stocks closed out a volatile week lower, and the S&amp;P 500's 2.2% decline was still its worst of the year.*****&gt; "The odds of something going wrong are much higher today than they were last Friday, when there was pretty much consensus that a [trade] deal was going to be done," said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.*****&gt; But strategists say the selling could have been even worse in the past week. They said stocks were supported by investor confidence that a deal will get done, and also the expectation that Trump would take action to avoid a market collapse.*****&gt; "I still think that the risks are perhaps skewed more to the downside, than the upside here. Whether it will escalate further is hard to handicap from a risk perspective," Keon said. The Trump administration has complained that China attempted to renegotiate their deal, so Trump raised tariffs to 25% on $200 billion in goods and threatens tariffs on $300 billion more.*****&gt; Whether the Chinese have changed their view, or their lack of agreement on some issues is just posturing is yet to be seen, Keon said.*****&gt; "The U.S. and China are rivals and are going to be economic rivals for many years to come. Doing a trade deal is going to be like the Yankees and Red Sox doing a trade deal. Nobody wants to be the guy who trades away Babe Ruth," he said.*****&gt; Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said it's not unusual for trade negotiations to hit a rough spot, as they near the finish line. "What really matters is whether you have those tariffs on for quite some time. Companies have been doing fairly well managing tariffs, whether it's by supply lines or price. The uncertainty is the problem for firms," he said.*****&gt; Tilley said he expects to see strength in the retail sales. Manufacturing data could be soft.*****&gt; "Our take is that the consumer is still in a very good place. We think a lot of the volatility, some of it was real in the sense it was the government shutdown and the movement of the stock market through December. There were some seasonal adjustments," he said.*****&gt; Analysts have said the fact the stock market was at a record high; first quarter growth was a strong 3.2%, and unemployment fell to a 50-year low of 3.6%, all likely emboldened Trump to play hardball with China. Likewise, improving economic data in China could have made Beijing believe it had a stronger hand.*****&gt; For now, markets are watching to see whether talks continue to be constructive or whether the two sides focus on retaliation.*****&gt; Tilley said he expects to see a deal, but if it looks like Trump will move forward with tariffs on all Chinese goods, he would reconsider his stock positions. "If that was coming and we thought that was going to be in place for some time, we would be forced to reevaluate and downgraded our economic outlook and also the outlook for the markets," said Tilley.*****# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://finviz.com/publish/051119/sec_all_w1_075084162.png))**# **Major Indices for this past week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/RTtU1yT.png))**# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/66IZoUM.png))**# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/vUzEEA7.png))**# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hxemRbp.png))**# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/l8WQMcG.png))**# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EhrciC1.png))**# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FQ5X0cR.png))**# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K8WRgC6.png))**# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7Ui6753.png))**# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9TrCzDM.png))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8Sfe6Jw.png))*******# Earnings Estimates Stand Firm&gt; Earnings growth projections have remained positive globally, even as trade tensions have rattled financial markets this week.&gt; Lately, headlines on the U.S.-China trade dispute have distracted investors, and a few pockets of the global economy have weakened over the last several months. Fixed income markets have positioned for a marked economic slowdown with the yield curve again nearing inversion (long-term rates falling below short-term rates).&gt; Uncertainty can be uncomfortable, but in times of market volatility, we encourage investors to focus on long-term fundamentals instead of short-term noise. One of the fundamental pillars we like to focus on is company earnings.&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, earnings in all three major global regions are expected to rise this year. U.S. companies are poised to lead, with consensus expectations for 4.2% profit growth in 2019.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/U.S.-Leads-Earnings-Growth-Prospects-for-2019-1.png?ssl=1))**&gt; “The bar for earnings results is low because of heightened uncertainty,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Economic growth may be moderating internationally, but we see enough catalysts ahead to drive another year of record profits in the U.S.”&gt; U.S. company profits escaped last quarter’s soft patch, based on earnings results from about 85% of constituents that have already reported. S&amp;P 500 Index profits likely grew about 1% year over year in the first quarter of 2019, markedly better than the 2–4% decline expected at the beginning of the reporting season, depending on the data source. Better-than-feared earnings have helped push the S&amp;P 500 to all-time highs over the past few weeks and we expect improving earnings to carry stocks going forward.&gt; Earnings expectations for developed and emerging markets (EM) are below U.S. projections. However, we think EM earnings projections may be too pessimistic. Global market volatility, trade tensions, and a strong U.S. dollar have contributed to reduced EM growth expectations in recent months, but we think the Federal Reserve’s pause should help cap gains in the U.S. dollar and help fuel stronger global currencies and EM economic activity.*****# Uncomfortable, but Expected&gt; Trade tensions have flared up again, and they’ve caught the stock market off guard.&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has dropped 2.1% over the past two days amid a slew of trade-related headlines. On May 6, the United States announced it would implement additional tariffs on Chinese imports at the end of the week if no trade agreement is reached. In response, China threatened its own retaliatory measures. China and U.S. officials are still scheduled to continue trade talks in Washington, D.C. May 9, but the threat of escalation looms large in investors’ minds.&gt; Recent market volatility has been uncomfortable, but not particularly surprising given the lack of turbulence year to date. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500’s largest pullback this year has been unusually small relative to previous years. Since 1970, the S&amp;P 500 has made it through the first five months of the year without at least a 2.5% pullback only once—in 1995.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019s-Biggest-Drawdown-is-the-Smallest-Since-1995.png?ssl=1))**&gt; On average, the S&amp;P 500 has endured an 8.5% pullback from January to May each year. This year, stocks haven’t come close to that. The largest S&amp;P 500 pullback this year has been a one-day slide of 2.48%.&gt; “Given the recent run we’ve had, we believe conditions are ripe for an increase in volatility,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Though we remain optimistic about U.S. stocks’ longer-term prospects, stocks recently reached overbought levels.”&gt; While volatility could take over in the near term, we see the resurgence in trade risk as a temporary obstacle to new S&amp;P 500 highs later this year. In our view, current trade headwinds will have a negligible impact on economic growth, and the U.S. economy has emerged relatively unscathed from what is traditionally the weakest quarter of the year. Economic fundamentals also point to higher prices: The labor market is steadily improving, corporate profits are at all-time highs, and inflation is healthy.&gt; In the meanwhile, we look for S&amp;P 500 support in the 2,775 range, the index’s 200-day moving average. If this level were to be reached, it would represent a 6% slide from record levels, and at the low range of a typical 6-10% market correction. Solid fundamentals and technical support may provide investors with potential for relief from the recent bout of market volatility.*****# May Option Expiration Week: Recent Weakness&gt; Trading around May option expiration is mostly a mixed bag. DJIA has been down nineteen of the last thirty-seven May expiration days with an average loss of 0.12%. The full-week has a bearish bias for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 with records of 20 declines and 17 advances over the past 37 years. More recently, DJIA has suffered declines in eight of the past ten expiration weeks.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a34c68045be0c0b1ff4548470db7a75d/tumblr_inline_prb1ioDfJZ1spdppr_500.jpg))**&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b27a001af1e4f0617690195460291d2a/tumblr_inline_prb1j7CIgQ1spdppr_500.jpg))**&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c7736d2601290b6096f7cabca78c27e4/tumblr_inline_prb1jhTzF91spdppr_500.jpg))*******# Rotate in May — Top Sectors for the “Worst Months” May to October&gt; Today we are not going to bother debating whether one should actually sell in May or not. Instead, let’s focus on some tactical adjustments that can be made in portfolios to take advantage of what actually does work during the “Worst Six Months” while either shorting or outright avoiding what does not work all that frequently.&gt; In the following table, the performance of the S&amp;P 500 during the “Worst Six Months” May to October is compared to fourteen select sector indices or sub-indices, gold and the 30-year Treasury bond. Nine of the fourteen indices chosen are S&amp;P Sector indices. Gold and 30-year bond are continuously-linked, non-adjusted front-month futures contracts. With the exception of two indices, 1990-2018, a full 29 years of data was selected. This selection represents a reasonably balanced number of bull and bear years for each and a long enough timeframe to be statistically significant while representing current trends. In an effort to make an apple-to-apple comparison, dividends are not included in this study.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ef156141ee3a14742dbf8c91837f80f/tumblr_inline_pr9c02KFIg1spdppr_500.jpg))**&gt; Using the S&amp;P 500 as the baseline by which all others were compared, five indices and the 30-year Treasury bond outperformed during the “Worst Six Months” while nine others and gold underperformed based upon “AVG %” return. At the top of the list are Biotech and Healthcare with average gains of 8.69% and 4.85% during the “Worst Months.” However, before jumping into Biotech positions, only 24 years of data was available and in those years, Biotech was up just 54.2% of the time from May through October. Some years, like 2014, gains were massive while in down years losses were frequently nearly as large. Although not the best sector by AVG %, Consumer Staples advancing 79.3% of the time is the closest thing to a sure bet for a gain during the “Worst Months.”*****# Market Celebrates Mother’s Day with Gains&gt; Over the last twenty-four years on the Friday before Mother’s Day the Dow Jones Industrials have gained ground sixteen times. On the Monday after, DJIA has advanced seventeen times. Average gain on Friday has been 0.19% and a respectable 0.49% on Monday. However, in four of the last seven years, the Monday following Mother’s Day has been down.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6949bf7582792d744e6caf5571ce504a/tumblr_inline_pr7b9bWGA61spdppr_500.jpg))*******# Relax It’s May Not China Trade War Fears&gt; A full blown trade war with China is not in anyone’s interest. President Trump’s negotiating style may be unsettling to the market at times, but neither country is likely to stand on ceremony to save face at the risk to their respective economies and markets. With the market at new highs and up big the first four months this year it is even more prone to short-term weakness in May.&gt; Our overall outlook for the year remains bullish as it has been since our Annual Forecastin December that was followed by a bullish January Indicator Trifecta. The historical strength of Pre-Election Years, which has been self-evident thus far this year, is supported by resilient economic and corporate readings, a dovish Fed clearly done with raising interest rates for the time being and a White House that is supportive of Wall Street. But, as you can see in the chart of Pre-Election Year Seasonal Patterns below, the Dow (black dotted line) and S&amp;P (green dotted line) are already at historical average gains for the Pre-Election year and NASDAQ is way ahead of the pace up more than 20% for 2019 to date.&gt; Ostensibly, the S&amp;P and NASDAQ are on the brink of clearing the last levels of resistance. But the Dow is struggling and Russell 2000 is well off the pace. S&amp;P and NASDAQ made new all-time highs last month, but are straining to hold those levels and there is chatter in technical analysis circles about a bearish double top forming on the S&amp;P and NASDAQ. Also evident in the chart here is the weakness often experienced in the latter part of May. So while we remain bullish on the year, we do expect the market to be weaker during the May soft patch and backing and filing during the Worst 4 Months July-October.&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c97a2af90145417a9030378aabff777c/tumblr_inline_pr3nnoML6C1spdppr_500.jpg))*******# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for May 10th, 2019**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 05.12.19**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)*****Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-*****&gt; * **$NVDA**&gt; * **$BABA**&gt; * **$ACB**&gt; * **$CSCO**&gt; * **$IQ**&gt; * **$BIDU**&gt; * **$WMT**&gt; * **$TTWO**&gt; * **$AMAT**&gt; * **$CYBR**&gt; * **$TLRY**&gt; * **$STNE**&gt; * **$M**&gt; * **$RL**&gt; * **$BILI**&gt; * **$LEGH**&gt; * **$WIX**&gt; * **$DE**&gt; * **$CPRX**&gt; * **$TME**&gt; * **$EAST**&gt; * **$LMB**&gt; * **$MYO**&gt; * **$KEM**&gt; * **$AZZ**&gt; * **$A**&gt; * **$PAGS**&gt; * **$MEEC**&gt; * **$MIME**&gt; * **$NTES**&gt; * **$CTST**&gt; * **$DARE**&gt; * **$CRMD**&gt; * **$TSG**&gt; * **$CPLP**&gt; * **$CELP**&gt; * **$BOOT**&gt; * **$NEWR**&gt; * **$GDS**&gt; * **$SESN**&gt; * **$AKTS**&gt; * **$LM**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/K8WRgC6.png))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/G2FWNOI.png))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S MOST NOTABLE PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q9yldQz.jpg))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/bViqZmD.png))*******Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:*****&gt; # ***Monday 5.13.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tx28j1z.png))&gt; # ***Monday 5.13.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eILBKWq.png))*****&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.14.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WAnmlba.png))&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.14.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vZzvy6a.png))*****&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.15.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sxy6Llf.png))&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.15.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/p4wLGmX.png))*****&gt; # ***Thursday 5.16.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SNhen2b.png))&gt; # ***Thursday 5.16.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pjJ8ii2.png))*****&gt; # ***Friday 5.17.19 Before Market Open:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/l9zdL1d.png))*****&gt; # ***Friday 5.17.19 After Market Close:***&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())NONE.*****# NVIDIA Corp. $168.82&gt; **NVIDIA Corp.
