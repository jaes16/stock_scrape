The NFL is massive. Huge. Last year the NFL had $14 billion in sales.The iPad, which has been viewed as an ugly step child by Wall Street brought in $23 billion last year. Crazy.  The iPad alone is over 60% bigger than the entire NFL.   Yet Wall Street views the iPad as a footnote in the overall financial performance of Apple. Crazy.Hell even Miscellaneous revenue is almost as big as the NFL.  Miscellaneous revenue is AppleTV, Beats, Airpod, AppleWatch, and accessories.  That alone was $11 BILLION in sales.Miscellaneous revenue was bigger than Major League Baseball and the NBA last year. Wow.
