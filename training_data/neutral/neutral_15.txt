Posting this here cause I just got banned from WSB. Not sure if it was cause of [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lax4z8/hardcore_laddering/glr2ktg/), but that's when the ban came in. It was automod as the msg says it was a bot. I just can't even ask why or ask for it to be reversed cause I was instantly muted as well. I get it, they are extremely busy.[Original post that flew to the top of WSB](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lax4z8/hardcore_laddering/)Link to see these trades - https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-tradesNow let's look at other stocks.

Please go through more stocks if you need more evidence than what I provided. I would love to be proven wrong so I feel better about GME, but going off of completely wrong information is just going to get us all burned even more.
