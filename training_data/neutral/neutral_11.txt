Full stock list: https://i.imgur.com/DgmNfSI.png (including some losers)The first position I bought was Facebook in 2013. Back when they couldn't monetize mobile and their users were leaving in droves and they bought that service called Instagram for 1B. I could not wait to buy in since they dominated social media and figured they would turn it around.The second position I bought was Disney in Feb 2014. I forget why they were struggling, but I looked at their 52 week chart and it seemed like a bargain at $74. It is one of the few non-tech stocks I bought.Over the next 6 to 18 months I bought the majority of my tech stocks when they were doing horribly and the buzz about them was horrible.  One of the last positions I got into was Apple.At one point I was down 20+% on all of my investments for months and basically just kept buying more when I was down a lot (20%+) on a specific stock that I believed in.  A good example is Amazon. (Another stock that I've done that with that hasn't turned out well is Under Armor.)Don't get me wrong, I was nervous the entire time I was buying and had no idea how things would turn out. I just bought stocks I believed in and figured time would tell.My strategy is basically sticking to the field I know well and try to buy market leaders at a good bargain compared to their historical highs. It could be that I just got lucky. I have no idea.  I pretty much ignored buy ratings or price estimates by experts and looked at P/E ratios and their position compared to competitors in their field.  If a market leader was near their 52 week low then they were definitely on my radar.Market pullbacks happen all the time and that is when it's a great time to start buying.  I spent weeks and months waiting for the best time to buy some stocks and it was driving me nuts waiting.Prior to these purchases I had zero experience in the stock market.  So my advice to you is, go ahead and give it a shot and learn as you go.
