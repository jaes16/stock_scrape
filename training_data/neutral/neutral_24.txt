Last month, I made %50 profit by QCOM-apple agreement by following tech news, therefore I miss the oppurtunity to buy appl cheap. I have no idea about other industries. is there any useful accurate website for such occasions. or should I watch just mainstread media and some ordinary economy blogs?&amp;#x200B;Note : I'm not talking about ''10 stocks to buy in 2019'' or ''123 stocks to boom in 2035'' kind of shit.&amp;#x200B;thank you all.
