**Banks**Earnings season kicked off in earnest on Tuesday with strong results from JP Morgan that were taken as a good omen for the economy in general and commercially focused banks in particular.  However, for me, the stand out bank reporting this week was **Pinnacle Financial Partners** which reported a 19% increase in Q3 EPS on Tuesday with double-digit loan and deposit growth, strong hiring throughout its businesses and substantial fee growth.Pinnacle is a small $4.5 billion Tennessee based commercial bank that has grown quickly using the strategy of recruiting top bankers from the larger regional banks and bringing in their teams and clients. That strategy has allowed Pinnacle to grow rapidly and profitably since bankers only bring over their best customers.  The company has doubled revenues over the past three years and strong Q3 growth shows the strategy is still working. The stock is up 3.5% since the report but, with a trailing PE of just 11.7, the market seems to be overlooking the growth and categorizing Pinnacle along with much less interesting bank stocks.&amp;#x200B;**Biopharmaceutical****Dermira** jumped 26% on Friday after the company published positive results from a mid-stage clinical trial for its new eczema treatment, lebrikizumab.  44% of patients treated with lebrikizumab exhibited 90% skin clearance. Thats similar to recently launched eczema treatment Dupixent. However, unlike Dupixent, lebrikizumab also proved to be effective at reducing chronic itching (pruritus) which is often a significant issue for eczema sufferers.  It also had less of an impact on the immune system.Dermira’s market cap was $390 million after Fridays rise.  However the stock could go a lot higher. There are nearly 7 million eczema sufferers in the US with currently untreatable conditions and the total addressable market for Dermira is estimated at $5 billion. Given its commercial advantages, regarding pruritus, Dermira should take a significant share of this if it can successfully transition from Phase 3 trials to FDA approval.&amp;#x200B;**Value Stocks****United Rentals** reported Q3 results on Wednesday with revenues up 17.6% and earnings up 17.4%.  Guidance was updated with revenues still expected to grow 6% for the year and the CEO said customers remain upbeat about their business prospects.  The market was not impressed, United Rentals after all has a large exposure to the construction industry and, as we near the end of the current up cycle, that is a concern.However United Rentals is much more than just a cyclical play. Growth is being driven by the benefits operators enjoy by renting machinery rather than owning machinery.  Renting allows customers to get the best and latest equipment, more flexibility, no storage costs and no debt. There is also still plenty of growth potential. United Rentals is the market leader but its market share is only 15%.  With crumbling US infrastructure and chronic housing shortages, it should expect to expand for many years to come. Current valuation with a trailing PE of 8.9 looks cheap.&amp;#x200B;**Large Caps (Netflix and Johnson &amp; Johnson)****Netflix** Q3 results on Wednesday were initially well received even though most of the 40% earnings surprise was accounted for by a once off non-cash item.  After adjusting for this, the core results still showed a very healthy 31% increase in revenues and 22.5% increase in earnings.However concerns about the imminent rise in (lower priced) competition from new streaming services to be provided by Disney+ and Apple TV+ hit home later on Thursday and Friday and the stock ended the week down 3.5%.  The focus has clearly switched to the reduced guidance for Q4 subscriber growth which now looks vulnerable and the valuation, at 88x trailing earnings and 7x trailing revenues, still looks very expensive.**Johnson &amp; Johnson** reported a Q3 beat and raise on Tuesday but any positivity unravelled on Friday when it was revealed that the company had recalled 33,000 bottles of baby powder after U.S. health regulators found trace amounts of asbestos. J&amp;J is working with the FDA to determine the integrity of the tested sample, and the validity of the test results, but it is nevertheless a set back for the company which has made repeated assurances regarding the products safety.Reputational issues aside, it could also prove very costly for the company. J&amp;J is fighting more than 14,000 lawsuits alleging its baby powder and talc products cause cancer. Last year, a St. Louis jury ruled that the company should pay $4.7 billion to 22 women who claimed the baby powder gave them ovarian cancer. The stock closed down 6.2% on Friday with a market capitalization of $337.0 billion.&amp;#x200B;**Acquisition**Unnamed sources at Bloomberg reported that Apollo Global Management had made a $40 offer for **Hilton Grand Vacations**, the timeshare resort operator, and that the Blackstone Group had also made an offer.  A bidding war could prove very profitable for investors, and the stock did jump about 5%, but at $34.34 it still remains well below the price quoted by “unnamed” sources. At that price, either the stock is offering us a great opportunity to buy or alternatively the story is a load of garbage.  I wish I knew which was true.&amp;#x200B;Please feel free to “FOLLOW” me if you would like to see my regular updates during the week.This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.
