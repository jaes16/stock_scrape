Hello,Mid twenty’s and I invested for the first time about 2yrs ago. All my stocks below have 30-150% profits. My question I am struggling with is do I hold hold hold onto these stocks for retirement and hope they continue to go up over 30yrs. Or do I take the profits and wait until the market drops and re invest?  I struggle with nobody has been hurt taking a profit vs I got in at such a good price point that even if the market drops I wouldn’t be able to buy it as cheap as I got in so I should hold until I’m old.NetflixAppleAmazonGoogleDr PepperFacebookMicrosoftWalmartFedexLower Profits marginsVerizonSouthwestVisaTysonThank you for the feedback.
