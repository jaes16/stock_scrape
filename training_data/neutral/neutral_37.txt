About twenty years ago, I had just graduated college. My grandfather had died years ago,  and he had left me a small amount to invest which was an account that, now graduated, I had access to. He had utilized a stock broker  and I was to  meet  with him.I was on a bit of a  tear.  I had just gotten my liberal arts degree, and  thought  I was  super smart.  And in all the arrogance of a sure-fire smart “kid” coming out of a liberal arts school and still buzzing a bit from the dotcom boom,  I  learned that I could make my own trades for 29.95 using s new site called “E*Trade”.  I spoke to my Dad about it, he said, talk to  broker,  but if that’s what you want to, do, it’s  your money (sort of with the whole, I wouldn’t do it, but go for it, I guess, attitude) I spoke to the broker for  the first time, and  after his pitch of  what the portfolio had done in the last five years and some  stocks I was going buy, it all sounded reasonable and good.  He seemed to know what he was talking about, but I still, in my  pushy arrogance of late adolescence , inquired how much I paid him per trade.  it  was considerably more than 30 dollars. I then asked if  I could make some suggestions  as to what we could buy.“What were you thinking of?”“Apple, for one,” I said.“Oh no, I don’t know about that.  They’ve had a lot of issues the last few years, and I wouldn’t recommend it.”More due to cost differential per trade than this vague analysis, I told him I think I’m going to go my own way.   I put about 1200 bucks into Apple, some less into the online book store  “amazon”, and a couple of index funds,  and a few other companies, that I  thought had a lot interesting hype around them.Sure enough, my apple investment looked horrible to start, losing about 40%  of  the value  within three months.  Same with Amazon.  I decided, though, to do nothing, and I was onto do different things.  I never  sold those shares, and today they’ve are  pretty close to appreciating to  10,000%.  I bought Apple a few more times throughout my life, and that  one stock has accrued in value (I mean, all of it theoretical, I suppose, unless I do sell)  about the same for me  than my paychecks throughout my career.I have generally  picked winners. I own shares in Sam Adams, in Tesla, in google, in facebook, in nvidia, etc.  and still have those index funds, that did quite well as everything has over  the last twenty years. What’s the lesson in all of this? I don’t think there is one. Get lucky. Don’t sell. And listen to  yourself, I  guess.
