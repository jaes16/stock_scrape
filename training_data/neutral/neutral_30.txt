Every time someone new posts about wanting to invest or asking if this is a good time to invest, one phrase always comes up and it's fucking pissing me off.*Oh yeah, go ahead, see if you can time the market big shot.*Nobody is fucking trying to time the market. That is literally impossible. Even people who have been investing for decades can't time the market. Nobody can predict the future. Some bubble could burst and the market could fall off a fucking cliff tomorrow.My point is, stop fucking badgering all the new guys who are trying to learn and deterring them from giving this is a try. All they really mean to say is that they believe this is a good time to buy because stocks are dropping so they are cheap. **When's the next time you'll be able to buy Apple or Disney for below $100?** That might not happen for a long time. Yeah if they buy tomorrow, the market could drop for the rest of the week, Disney could fall down into the high 80s and they might have a small loss for a bit. But it will eventually fucking climb back up. It's fucking Disney. Not some penny stock. Thinking long term, this is a good time to buy. Stocks like Disney will climb. I'm buying. Fuck you and your discouragement.
