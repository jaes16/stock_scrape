I would go with Disney, Hasbro, Apple, Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway- Disney is in a unique position on content. They got everything from Hulu,Pixar, Star Wars to excellent intellectual property and thousands of stories to be told.- Hasbro also is in a unique Position, as they profit from the global wealth creation, as more parents are able to spent more money for their kids. And as I believe classic games like Monopoly or Dungeons and Dragons are timeless and will be played in the future, wether it is digital or not. I also believe they will successfully make the step into the movie industry, since they got enough ip to successfully merchandise.- Apple has a huge moat. Once you use their systems, you stay with them.- Amazon makes the most out of online retail, which shouldnâ€™t be stopped anytime soon.- What else is a better investment than giving your money to the best investor of all time ?
