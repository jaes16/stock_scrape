3rd QTR earnings results: iPhone is less then 50% of Apple's revenue.Services is about 20% of revenue and growing fast. Wearables is 10% of revenue and growing even faster. iPad and Mac are also growing.Amazing job by Tim Cook. Apple is no longer a 1 trick Pony and ready to continue to grow for many years.Because of this AAPL's multiple must go up. When revenue was 70% iPhone the risk of concentrated revenue streams was high. Thus Apple got docked for that. Not anymore. AAPL is a diversified company and deserves a higher PE.New 12-month target price: $275
