I want to invest long term, and if I'm gonna do that, I don't see any reason not to invest in the S&amp;P 500. But obviously, millions of peoples still choose to invest in apple, disney, coke, etc. So what am I missing here? Is the "most traders won't beat the market" an exaggeration? I would appreciate some insight.
