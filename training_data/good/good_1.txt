What are three growth stocks that you're very confident will grow substantially by 2030?I think if we look back in 2010, some companies that would be pretty easy choices would include Google, Microsoft, and Apple. I don't think anyone believed they would fail by 2020. And they've provided average annual returns of around 20, 22, and 26% since then.
