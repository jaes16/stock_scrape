Hi guys. So as a relatively new investor, I got in at Apple at 215, Disney at 95 and also did an etf at 240. We're going to be seeing big gains tomorrow so overall I'm going to be up about  ~20%.Chances are, the stocks will probably go up a bit more in the next few weeks and I may be prematurely selling. But I'm going to be laid off in the future and I also think that in the future, the market will drop. A 20% gain since 3 weeks ago seems solid in this uncertain market.So I'm likely going to take the gains now and ill test the market again when that time comes.  I have a decent amount in savings but I think we're close to the peak before it'll slowly drop down. It probably won't test the March lows but hey, profit is profit.Want to wish you guys luck with whatever investment decisions you decide to make
