Just sold my shares of CCL, PENN, and DKNG. More then doubled my money on all of them.My only position left is MGM.I know very little about the stock market I got into it 2 months ago bc a friend said I could make money since most stocks crashed. Now I have no idea where to go from here as my initial strategy was to profit off of stocks wrecked by corona virus. I feel like I know nothing about what to invest in now or what is a good value as the market seems to be back to normal.It seems as if I should dump all the money into MIcrosoft, Apple, etc. any advice is appreciated
