 The move, which affects suppliers to major international brands such as Apple, Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, could force companies to sever some ties to China. The list of sanctioned companies includes current and former suppliers to major international brands such as Apple, Ralph Lauren, Google, HP, Tommy Hilfiger, Hugo Boss and Muji, according to [a report](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/uyghurs-sale) by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank established by the Australian government. The group cited the websites of the sanctioned Chinese companies, which mentioned their financial relationships with major American brands.The blacklist only prevents U.S. companies from selling components or technologies to Chinese companies without a license, not from purchasing products. In practice, however, major international brands are unlikely to continue doing business with any firm named on a government list for forced labor or other abuses in Xinjiang.[NYT- ARTICLE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/business/economy/china-sanctions-uighurs-labor.html)

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-ark-innovation-wood/record-redemption-in-ark-etf-sparks-liquidity-worries-idUSKBN2AO2Q2 A record half-billion dollar redemption from Ark Invest's flagship fund in a single day has led analysts to highlight the risks arising from the ETF's heavy exposure to illiquid stocks if outflows pick up pace.Investors yanked $465 million from Ark Innovation on Monday, according to Refinitiv data. More such redemptions would prompt Wood's fund to sell liquid holdings to manage the squeeze in the near-term before looking to unwind its illiquid holdings.Ark Invest meanwhile shuffled its portfolio on Tuesday by cutting its already-tiny holdings in Apple, Amazon, Taiwan Semiconductor and Google-owner Alphabet to beef-up its Tesla stake on Wednesday.This is one of the problem that ark funds is trying to mitigate. Many people are very bullish and saying they are 50 to 70% into the ark funds, but they don't even know what stocks are inside these funds. People please realize that ark funds are high risk high return funds, so you should only invest a reasonable % of your portfolio into these funds.Thanks for the awards.
[https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/20/tech/tech-companies-against-tariff/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/20/tech/tech-companies-against-tariff/index.html)&amp;#x200B;&gt;Technology companies have been feeling the sting of the escalating trade war between the United States and China. Now, they're trying to avoid a proposed new round of tariffs that takes aim at many American tech products.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;More than half a dozen big tech companies wrote to the Trump Administration this week asking it not to hit the products they produce in China with additional tariffs.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The White House has proposed a bill that would place a 25% tariff on $300 billion in Chinese goods not already subject to tariffs. The tariff would apply to a wide range of products, from live buffalo and primates to T-shirts and shoes. It would also cover laptops, video game consoles, battery cases and other products that tech companies say would increase costs for consumers or harm their abilities to make a profit.&amp;#x200B;&gt;"No one wins in a trade war, and an escalating tariff fight will inflict immense damage on American businesses, workers and consumers," the Association wrote.&amp;#x200B;&gt;The trade dispute has forced some tech companies to look beyond China for new locations, mostly in Southeast Asia, to produce their goods. But leaving China is a slow and costly process, because the country has for decades amassed the infrastructure, talent and suppliers needed for manufacturing.
Apple stock went down 1.90% when at the time they revealed the price tag for the new iPhone X ($999)
 Apple accused in U.S. lawsuit of securities fraud over iPhone sales in China (Reuters) - Apple Inc was accused in a new lawsuit of securities fraud  for concealing a slump in demand for iPhones, particularly in China,  leading to a $74 billion one-day slide in its market value once the  truth became known.    The complaint filed on Tuesday seeks damages for  investors who bought Apple stock in the two months before Chief  Executive Tim Cook on Jan. 2 unexpectedly reduced Apple’s quarterly  revenue forecast as much as $9 billion, in part because of the  intensifying U.S. trade war with China.[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-lawsuit/apple-accused-in-u-s-lawsuit-of-securities-fraud-over-iphone-sales-in-china-idUSKCN1RT22H?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews&amp;utm\_source=feedburner&amp;utm\_medium=feed&amp;utm\_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FbusinessNews+%28Business+News%29](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-lawsuit/apple-accused-in-u-s-lawsuit-of-securities-fraud-over-iphone-sales-in-china-idUSKCN1RT22H?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FbusinessNews+%28Business+News%29)&amp;#x200B;This is going to leave a mark. Cook shot the pooch with this deal. From then on Apple is now being seen as moving over to the darkside.
$AKS - The only real profitable steel stock with plenty of room for further growth. It is both a value and growth stock. Better than $X and $STLD. The predicted earnings (and surprise factor) for $AKS is through the roof, much stronger than $X and $STLD.$RSX - OPEC just cut oil production which will benefit Russia and Iran the most. $RSX is an ETF managed by VanEck which is a US investment management company, and tracks Russia's commodities, industrials and resource-heavy companies. Russia's economy is already forecast to come out of recession in 2017. 1.6%~1.8% is the Russian economy's projected GDP growth rate WITHOUT an OPEC oil production cut, and this will go higher now, maybe even pushing &gt;2% GDP growth rate. The $RSX hit rock-bottom on January 15, 2016 (a level not seen since the 2008/2009 GFC) and has been rising since then. It's still early, so I highly recommend getting in before everyone jumps in (hindsight is always 20/20.. once this ETF rises by 100%+, then all the average Joes will start to get in as always). The $RSX is only just starting to rise, and is still cheap, much better value and has a superior growth prospect compared to the small-cap $RSXJ, which has doubled this year. The $RSX has huge potential to double by end of next year, maybe even triple, seeing how elite investors are so bullish on Russia (you don't see this on the front pages of Bloomberg or MarketWatch). I just made $1200 off of it today. The $RSX is industrials/commodities heavy, an area which Russia struggled with since international sanctions were placed on it due to Crimea and Syria. Now with the Obama/Clinton administration gone, these sanctions will get gradually eased. Republicans may be hawkish on Russia, but much less so than the Obama- and Clinton-led Democrats. And Trump is known to be much more diplomatic towards Russia than Clinton. Plus I don't think there is an Iran ETF, nor would I consider investing in it anyway with Trump's negative stance on Iran.Note: I strongly believe that Russia will be the best emerging market to invest in for 2017~2020. This is because Russia has faced a catastrophic economic collapse from 2014~2016 and is only starting to improve. Brazil's economy has been mired by internal problems, not due to sanctions. Therefore, Brazil and other South American/Central American markets pose continual risks as a Trump presidency does not present them with any advantages. Mexico will prove to be very a volatile market to invest in under a US Trump presidency. India is currently experiencing a cash crisis. Peruvian and other small South American ETFs have already soared too much in 2015/2016. $RSX is the best investment among emerging market ETFs with the potential for higher, sustained returns.$GM - rising oil prices usually don't mean great gasoline car sales. However, $GM is beating $TSLA to the affordable all-electric vehicle race and $GM has increased its profitability in the most recent quarter. This is set to improve dramatically over 2017. Trump, although criticizing $GM over manufacturing cars overseas such as in Mexico, is known to be friendly towards $GM. $GM will perform much better than $TSLA as the new all-electric Chevy Bolt will be delivered to customers in January 2017, whereas $TSLA will most likely delay the release and deliveries of the Tesla Model 3.$FCX - OPEC just cut oil production and copper is still in booming mode. The stock is still down 75% from its 2010-highs. Enough said. DO NOT BELIEVE analysts who downgrade this stock. Many of them think they have missed the $FCX train and want to bring down the stock. For example, Berenberg attempted to bring down the stock today by downgrading $FCX to "Sell", yet the stock rose 3.15% today &amp; after-hours. Absolute nonsense. This is a high growth stock continuing into 2017.$MU - the semiconductor industry has been booming due to rising DRAM prices. The companies that have benefited the most are Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Micron ($MU). However, Samsung Electronics is trading at all-time highs and you can't buy SK Hynix except on an ETF or a non-easily-accessible ADR. Therefore, buying $MU makes more sense. $MU is still down 50% from its 2014-highs and will most likely reach this level or surpass that by 2017~2018. DRAM prices will only increase as demand for AI and more complex electronic components in cars increases. And let's not forget Intel's massive drive into 3D XPoint and AI as well. The semiconductor industry will continue to see a boom continuing forwards.$HUM - the most profitable and bullish private healthcare stock under a Trump presidency.$BAC - bullish banking stock. Not just this stock, though. There are many many US banking corporations to choose from, some obviously better choices (e.g. $GS) than others.$LMT, $RTN, $NOC, $HEI, $ESLT - Aerospace and defense stocks will be bullish under a Republican government. Very priced in ATM.Dark horses:$AMD - up ~300% in 2016. Vega and Zen will be major potential growth drivers. I certainly see $AMD having major upside potential if these are even moderately successful. And $AMD is returning to profitability. We will see what happens. Its partnership with $GOOGL is looking very promising for revenue and profit growth too.$NVDA - similar to $AMD, up nearly 300% this year. It's range expansion on Nov 10, 2016 to the $80~$90 range was a huge surprise for most investors. Since then, it has lost forward momentum. I think $NVDA will see a moderate increase in its stock price in the short-medium term (a drawback soon is to be expected, though, looking at MACD and RSI), and it can potentially reach $150 by end of 2017. If $TSLA fails to deliver, it could be risky for $NVDA. However, in the long run, AI is still required for all types of driverless vehicle technology as well as other AI applications such as robotics and deep learning, as well as defense projects. So any trouble at $TSLA does not present a high extrapolated risk to $NVDA. Plus strong GPU sales and partnerships in the console space should protect $NVDA from hitting its stock price when uncertainty looms in the AI world.Stocks NOT to buy:$TSLA - Time after time, $TSLA has disappointed its investors. The SEC is now accusing $TSLA with reporting unrealistic accounting numbers. $TSLA will most likely be late in releasing and delivering its Model 3 vehicles due to the $SCTY merger. There are also rumors that Panasonic may charge Tesla more for its batteries. So this may shift Tesla to seek other ventures with companies such as LG Chem, which may prove to be more expensive than initially thought.$AAPL - Lack of innovation much? The new Macbook is a complete disaster. $AAPL should be a much better buy before September 2017, though. I do believe that the iPhone 8 will be a form factor upgrade, which should boost sales, although the boost wont be anything like iPhone 5S -&gt; iPhone 6. The iPhone 8 may have a curved AMOLED display similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge/Galaxy Note 7. Competition from Samsung may also be a risk factor as Samsung is heavily investing into AI integration into their phones, and their recent acquisition of Harman may prove to be highly advantageous for their smartphones as well as their auto parts business. It doesn't help that Apple failed to capitalize on Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recall scandal. Apple is a highly profitable company, however 2016 has seen its debt skyrocket. We shall see what happens with this stock, however it is not a good short-medium term play by any means and is not a good buy now for the long term either. This is because $AAPL stock is cyclical in nature (more so than other stocks) and tends to fall during November-January. Buy now at your own risk.Disclaimer: These opinions were written with some contributions from a friend, who is a 12-year experienced investment banker and has been trading stocks for more than 15 years.

Realistic Contenders:-Apple Inc.-Alphabet Inc.-Microsoft-Amazon-Facebook-Alibaba-TencentOut of these I think Alibaba has the best chance of getting there. The chinese middle class is stil growing like crazy and I don't see why this stock will halt anytime soon. I think Apple has peaked as a company and it's downhill from here on out. They are not innovative anymore like rivaling companies and its losing marketshare each quarter world wide in the past year. I feel amazon is at a good place however it will not increase rapidly like it did in the past year in the near future. Microsoft will grow forever and probably the safer stock to invest in but it's a slow grower. I feel facebook has already capped out on how big it can get in its current sector. So unless they keep branching out to other areas I don't think this stock growing rapidly in the near future. Don't know much about tencent tbh. But it's growing massively.So I think Alibaba will reach the $1 trillion evaluation first with its only real challengers being alphabet and tencent.
Qualcomm Inc. fired back at Apple Inc. in their legal battle, defending its business model and seeking damages from Apple over withheld payments for technology used in iPhones.Qualcomm QCOM, whose chips and patents are widely used in smartphones, accused Apple, of mischaracterizing the chipmaker’s business and encouraging international regulators to attack it.The filing, which Qualcomm said it made late Monday in a federal court in Southern California, argues that Apple’s iPhone business wouldn’t exist had Qualcomm not developed essential technologies and agreed to license them fairly. The iPhone accounted for three-fourths of Apple’s estimated $84 billion gross profit in its latest fiscal year, according to investment bank CLSA.

Last week was absolutely amazing. I hope everyone here had good gains and took profits as well! My picks from last week did exceptionally well:* GOOGL - 5.4%* BABA - 10.6%* V - 4.24%* PYPL - 6.9%* QQQ - 3.95%Looking into this week, we are due for some consolidation or pullback, but there are a still plays that could work out this week. As always, I have this in video format [which you can watch here](https://youtu.be/PoibBodbkLU) if you don't want to read this block of text.1. Apple (AAPL) - So although tech had a big week, Apple kind of lagged behind. It's a slow mover, BUT, once it gets moving, it makes big moves. The technicals show it's at a critical point for a breakout, so keep a close eye on this. If we see any news leak about positive iPhone 10 sales over the holiday season, expect this to go to ATH. Also ER is scheduled for Feb 1, so we will most likely see a run up soon enough.2. Nvidia (NVDA) - Solid company, and it had a rough couple of months after breaking the $200 level. Now we're back, and with CES around the corner, I suspect this will have a good move as well. Earnings again I believe is in Feb. If you look @ the technicals, you can see that it broke a key uptrend resistance level on STRONG volume - this is a very good sign for the stock as buyers have come back in and believe it should move higher. When Nvidia gets moving, we see it move A LOT, so this is a good one to watch this week.3. Square (SQ) - Recovering from ATH of $50 from couple months ago, Square is starting to make a comeback. We saw it bottom out around $34 or so (I personally wanted it to $30, but that's fine...) and now we see some movement upwards. Once again, we broke resistance on good volume, and now we bounced off support (and the 50 day) with STRONG volume. This is good confirmation that we are ready to start heading back to the ATH of $50 in this stock, but it may take a few weeks to get there. Friday had amazing movement, and overall I think we have a lot more room to move here. I personally picked up some LEAPs (Jan 2019 expiry, 50C) and they were fairly cheap. I don't think we'll have any problems seeing Square back at $50 before Jan 2019...4. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) - They got a nice rally thanks to the news that came out from EA last week. Typically gaming stocks like to follow each others movement (EA, ATVI, TTWO), but I think technically, TTWO has the best charts and the best potential for a swing trade. If you look @ the charts, you can see that it broke through a key resistance level, on good volume, so we should be watching it closely next week to see if volume continues on with this. The stock has been beaten down since making new ATH a few months ago, although nothing fundamentally changed, so I think we'll see a good move up in the upcoming weeks as long as the market keeps moving up.5. Walmart (WMT) - This is a new stock I've never covered on my 5 stocks weekly videos, but the consolidation on this caught my attention. I have a position in them, longer dated calls, because I do believe we are just waiting for a Catalyst to gap up and move higher. This is the first time the stock closed above $100, which is typically a big resistance point for a stock to get past. It has consolidated around here since its last ER, and this move up was expected. Now as long as volume comes in, we could see this at $105-$110 before the next ER. If we see news come out that they had a record holiday season or something like this, I expect it to gap up and start a good rally. Walmart is a slow mover though, so it may take a few weeks to see movement here, but keep an eye on it!So that covers the 5 stocks for this week. As always, please comment below to share what stocks you're watching this week, what you think about these 5 stocks that I covered, and how you did with your picks from the previous week.Happy investing!
